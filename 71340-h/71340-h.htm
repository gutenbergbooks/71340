<p class="c sp lp">WE SET OUT</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is a gentle art; know how to tramp and
you know how to live. Manners makyth
man, and tramping makyth manners. Know
how to meet your fellow wanderer, how to
be passive to the beauty of Nature and how
to be active to its wildness and its rigor.
Tramping brings one to reality.</p>

<p>If you would have a portrait of Man you
must not depict him in high hat and carrying
in one hand a small shiny bag, nor would one
draw him in gnarled corduroys and with red
handkerchief about his neck, nor with lined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
brow on a high bench watching a hand that
is pushing a pen, nor with pick and shovel
on the road. You cannot show him carrying
a rifle, you dare not put him in priest’s garb
with conventional cross on breast. You will
not point to King or Bishop with crown or
miter. But most fittingly you will show a
man with staff in hand and burden on his
shoulders, striving onward from light to darkness
upon an upward road, shading his eyes
with his hand as he seeks his way. You will
show a figure something like that posthumous
picture of Tolstoy, called “Tolstoy pilgrimaging
toward eternity.”</p>

<p>So when you put on your old clothes and
take to the road, you make at least a right
gesture. You get into your right place in the
world in the right way. Even if your tramping
expedition is a mere jest, a jaunt, a spree,
you are apt to feel the benefits of getting into
a right relation toward God, Nature, and your
fellow man. You get into an air that is refreshing
and free. You liberate yourself from
the tacit assumption of your everyday life.</p>

<p>What a relief to escape from being voter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
taxpayer, authority on old brass, brother of
man who is an authority on old brass, author
of best seller, uncle of author of best seller.</p>

<p>What a relief to cease being for a while a
grade-three clerk, or grade-two clerk who has
reached his limit, to cease to be identified by
one’s salary or by one’s golf handicap. It is
undoubtedly a delicious moment when Miles
the gardener seeing you coming along in
tramping rig omits to touch his hat as you
pass. Of course it is part of the gentle art
not to be offended. It is no small part of the
gentle art of tramping to learn to accept the
simple and humble rôle and not to crave respect,
honor, obeisance. It is a mistake to
take to the wilderness clad in new plus-fours,
sports jacket, West-End tie, jeweled tie pin,
or in gaiters, or carrying a silver-topped cane.
One should not carry visiting cards, but try
to forget the three-storied house remembering
Diogenes and his tub.</p>

<p>I suppose one should draw a distinction between
professional tramping and just tramping,
especially as this whole book is to be called
<i>The Gentle Art of Tramping</i>. I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
writing of the American hobo, nor of the British
casual, nor of railroaders and beach combers
or other enemies of society—“won’t
works” and parasites of the charitable. While
among these there are many very strange and
interesting exceptions, yet in general they are
not highly estimable people, nor is their way
of life beautiful or worth imitation. They
learn little on their wanderings beyond how
to cadge, how to steal, how to avoid dogs and
the police. They are not pilgrims but outlaws,
and many would be highway robbers had they
the vitality and the pluck necessary to hold
up wayfarers. Most of them are but poor
walkers, so that the word tramp is often misapplied
to them.</p>

<p>The tramp is a friend of society; he is a
seeker, he pays his way if he can. One includes
in the category “tramp” all true Bohemians,
pilgrims, explorers afoot, walking
tourists, and the like. Tramping is a way of
approach, to Nature, to your fellowman, to a
nation, to a foreign nation, to beauty, to life
itself. And it is an art, because you do not
get into the spirit of it directly you leave your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
back door and make for the distant hill. There
is much to learn, there are illusions to be overcome.
There are prejudices and habits to be
shaken off.</p>

<p>First of all there is the physical side: you
need to study equipment, care of health, how
to sleep out of doors, what to eat, how to cook
on the camp fire. These things you teach
yourself. For the rest Nature becomes your
teacher, and from her you will learn what is
beautiful and who you are and what is your
special quest in life and whither you should
go. You relax in the presence of the great
healer and teacher, you turn your back on
civilization and most of what you learned in
schools, museums, theaters, galleries. You
live on manna vouchsafed to you daily, miraculously.
You stretch out arms for hidden
gifts, you yearn toward the moonbeams and
the stars, you listen with new ears to bird’s
song and the murmurs of trees and streams.
If ever you were proud or quarrelsome or
restless, the inflammation goes down, fanned
by the coolness of humility and simplicity.
From day to day you keep your log, your daybook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of the soul, and you may think at first
that it is a mere record of travel and of facts;
but something else will be entering into it,
poetry, the new poetry of your life, and it will
be evident to a seeing eye that you are gradually
becoming an artist in life, you are learning
the gentle art of tramping, and it is giving
you an artist’s joy in creation.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>OOTS and the Man I sing! For you cannot
tramp without boots. The commonest
distress of hoboes is thinness of sole.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Jog on, jog on the foot-path way</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>And merrily hint the stile-a</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>The merry heart goes all the way</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>The sad tires in a mile-a.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sad heart, in this case, often has just a
thin sole. Two friends set out last spring to
tramp from Bavaria to Venice, luggage in advance,
knapsack on shoulder. But they had
not the right sort of boots, and they lingered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
in the mountain inns quaffing steins of brown
beer to take their thoughts away from their
toes. They are in those mountains yet.</p>

<p>You should have leather-lined boots with
most substantial soles. They may squeak,
they may feel clumsy as sabots when you first
put them on. They may feel like comfortable
baskets on your feet. Slight and elegant boots
seldom stand the strain, or, if they do, your
feet do not. I have tramped in little steel-soled
boots in the Caucasus, and in plaited
birch-bark boots, <i>lapti</i>, in the North, but I do
not recommend novelties in footwear. It is
difficult to better a new pair of Army boots.
But the best I ever had were a pair of chrome
leather fishing boots which I once bought in a
wayside shop in the Catskill Mountains. My
feet were in a poor state, having got frozen by
night and blistered by day in a disgusting pair
of light boots. I got into these capacious fishing
boots one evening and never felt another
twinge all the way to Chicago. As regards
Army boots, men suffered on the march because
often they were wearing other men’s
boots worn and shaped already to a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
pair of feet and then patched and cobbled.
One cannot with advantage wear dead men’s
boots.</p>

<p>Of course, one should go gradually with a
really stout pair of boots. Beware of the zest
of the first and second day’s tramping. It is
so easy to cripple oneself on the second day
out. You dispose of the first surface blisters,
and then you get the deeper, more painful,
blisters, and those you cannot squeeze. They
intend to squeeze you. One should wear thick
woolen socks, or even two pairs of socks at the
same time. When the socks wear out one can
even increase the number of pairs to three,
though it is better to discard socks that have
worn to hard shreds. I do not believe in soaping
socks, though it does not hurt to put them
on damp. One should try to get a dip every
day, in mountain stream or lake. An ideal
combination is sea-bathing and tramping. The
salt-water exercise certainly helps the feet. It
takes several days to get town-nurtured feet
into condition. With that in mind one should
not overdo it at the beginning. Mile averages
are a curse. So are definite programs. Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
a good cricketer, you should play yourself in
before you begin to score.</p>

<p>Of all tramping the most delightful is in
the mountains; the most trying is along great
highways. Both have their place in the ideal
tramp’s life. But experience teaches where
the most fun is to be found. Mountain walking
is really much less tiring because, first of
all, there is no dust, then there is more contrast
and mental distraction, and last, not
least, one’s feet hit the earth at varying angles,
employing more muscles. The sole does not
hit a road with monotonous regularity upon
the same dry spot of blistering skin.</p>

<p>I find that in the mountains a boot of rather
lighter sole is preferable, with either brads or
Phillips rubbers. One must nevertheless beware
of shoddy. After the second scramble
amid rocks I have seen the whole sole of a
boot part company with the upper. I have
seen the heel come off. Well established lines
of workingmen’s boots are safer than fair-seeming
boots for clerks. On the other hand,
boots whose nails come through are a nuisance,
digging holes in the soles of one’s feet. Boots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
which are letting iron in should be hammered
inside with a stone, but if, as often happens,
some sharp nail edge cannot be smoothed it is
as well to put in a certain amount of paper
till a cobbler can be found to right the
wrong.</p>

<p>Metal plates, “bradies,” on the outside of
the soles are of little use as they get very
smooth and slippery. Brads also wear to be
more slippery than plain leather. The new
type of very hard rubber patches made by
Phillips and others are ideal for climbing. It
is to be remembered that tramping across
country in the mountains one comes to steep
and dangerous descents, and upon occasion
one risks one’s neck on the grip of one’s feet.
That is where the Army type of rubbers comes
in. As an auxiliary it is not a bad plan to have
a light pair of tennis shoes in the pack, as you
can get over some obstacles in prehensile rubber
shoes which one could never negotiate in
boots. But hard rubber bars across one’s
leather soles are in any case very good. These
rubbers would “draw” your feet on an exposed
level road. But in the mountains one’s feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
keep cooler, and the comfort of a safe grip on
slippery rocks is not to be disdained. When
in the Rockies with Vachel Lindsay he had
bradded boots, but they got very shiny and
smooth, and he could slide in them. In certain
dangerous descents we made I could see that
much-worn bradded boots were clearly at a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>It is a good plan on a long tramp to carry
a duplicate pair of boots in the pack. While
it adds to the weight carried there is a counter-balancing
pleasure in a change of footgear
now and then. It is moreover possible that in
wild country one may wear out one solid pair
of boots in a month or so. Uppers have a way
of bursting in the mountains, especially when
one indulges in rushing down great slopes of
silt with myriads of knife-edged little stones.
By the way, one should beware of toasting
one’s feet in front of camp fires, or of leaving
one’s boots too near the embers when sleeping
out. If not using them as the foundation of
a pillow, it is well to put them in a fresh and
airy place, smearing a little grease on them
perhaps, to keep the uppers soft and pliable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Beware, however, of the grease getting near
the bread.</p>

<p>Boots are, of course, not a poetic subject.
Kipling used the word to express the boredom
of route marching:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>I’ve marched six weeks in ’Ell an’ certify</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>It is not fire, devils, dark or anything</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>But boots, boots, boots, boots, boots.</i>...</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The boot, like the thumbscrew, was an instrument
of torture of the Inquisition. But
nevertheless, it must be remembered, old boots
bring good luck. That is why one ties them
to the hymeneal coach. On life’s tramp together,
may the blissful pair have the comfort
and easy-going happiness of a well-worn boot.</p>

<p>The tramp gets affectionately attached to
his boots when they have served him long and
well, and may even wax patriotic in looking at
them and say, like Dickens in America, “This,
sir, is a British boot.”</p>

<p>Poems addressed to boots are hard to find,
and one must assume that poets for the most
part do not tramp. For if they tramp there
inevitably comes the pathetic moment when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
looking upon discarded boots by starlight the
poet says: “Oh, boot, have you not served me
well, old boot, old friend!” There is a lost
poetry in boots—“lines addressed to my favorite
boots,” “lines written after taking off my
most cruel boots,” “lines written before putting
on my boots.” The last, on the occasion
of putting them on swollen and blistered feet,
might be the occasion of a long, reflective
poem.</p>

<p>But enough, we at least have our boots on,
and are ready to proceed with the story of our
tramping art.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is wonderful how much you can carry
when it is for pleasure. Soldiers grumble
like camels at the loads put on their shoulders.
Under some one’s orders they shall march
with packs on their backs to such a point to-day,
to such another point</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>With your best foot first and the road a-sliding past,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>An’ every bloomin’ camping ground exactly like the last.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The camel groans, the soldier grouses, but
the gay tramp puts ever something more into
his capacious rucksack for pleasure or profit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
There’s a hunk of tobacco, there’s his favorite
volume of poems, his sketchbook—his danger
is in putting in too much and not putting in
the right things.</p>

<p>I assume he is to be equipped for sleeping
<i>à la belle étoile</i>. I may mention one or two
things he might overlook. First, the pack
itself should be well made. I have found in
the past that Germans and Austrians make
the best rucksacks, and even the best in London
seemed to be imported from these countries.
The one I have now was purchased some
years ago in Vienna, but I think it was the
best to be found there. There were many
shoddy ones about. The shopkeeper pretended
that the one I chose was not for sale,
and I spent twelve hours getting it. Not that
it is remarkable, but it is a genuinely well
made article. Exterior pockets which will not
burst are a necessary; interior pockets are also
useful.</p>

<p>The worst of the interior of a rucksack is
that after a while everything in it gets mixed.
Spare boots and linen get sprinkled with
coffee; different foods mingle. Some paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
wrapper bursts and the sugar spills over everything.
Then writing papers, books, or notebooks
get greasy. But this is avoided if one
provides oneself with half-a-dozen cotton bags
which tie with tapes. If these are not obtainable
at home they are to be found in some sort
of form at a Woolworth’s or a cheap draper’s.
It is a small detail, but a matter of comfort:
if you feel so disposed you wash out these
little cotton bags when they get dirty.</p>

<p>Another valuable extra to put in the rucksack
is a few yards of mosquito netting which
can be bought quite cheaply, sometimes called
brides’ veil in the shops, sometimes leno, sometimes
butter-muslin. With this you can defy
the mosquito at nights, and by day you can
enjoy the luxury of a sun-bath siesta watching
the flies which cannot bite your nose.
Apropos of the mosquito netting the choice
of hat is important. Do not take a cap. You
need a brim. And do not take a straw hat.
You cannot lie down comfortably with a straw
hat on. A tweed hat is best. The brim has
a double use. It shields your eyes from the
sun, but also, when you lie down where flies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and mosquitoes abound, you had best sleep in
your hat and use the brim to lift the mosquito
net an inch from your face. N.B.—A
tramping hat does not get old enough to throw
away. The old ones are the best. Of course,
once you have slept a night wearing your hat
it is not much more use for town wear. It has
become more tramp than you are.</p>

<p>I am in favor of carrying a blanket. It is
less cumbersome than a sleeping sack and
more hygienic. If, however, insects are very
troublesome, as in the tropics, and there are
“land crabs” and scorpions and tarantulas and
what not about, a light sleeping sack may be
improvised by sewing together three sides of
a pair of small sheets. This I have done: it
gets rather airless and smelly. It is best to
turn it inside out in the morning and give it
plenty of sun. But a blanket will do: take a
couple if you are chilly. This makes weight
on the back, but it is also a softening comfort
and fits the rucksack upon the shoulders on
a long hike.</p>

<p>There is no point whatever in carrying an
overcoat, though a waterproof cape or an oilskin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
comes in useful. A blanket and a cape
form a useful combination. One can sleep
on the cape with the blanket over one.</p>

<p>In one of the little cotton bags you will
carry your toilet requisites, soap and towel
and comb. Some men like to let their beard
grow on a long tramp and thus dispense with
razor and brush. Still, there are few things
more refreshing than the cold shave at dawn,
the rushing stream, the lather scattering itself
on ferns and flowers, the brandishing arm, the
freshening cheek.</p>

<p>A vital consideration at that time in the
morning is the coffeepot. I am in favor of
carrying an ordinary metal <i>cafetière</i>; some
prefer a kettle, but it bumps too much on the
back; others a pail, but the water in it is apt to
get smoky. In the United States there are so
many clean empty cans lying about that it is
perhaps unnecessary to carry anything of the
kind. The cowboys never carry anything in
the nature of a coffeepot. They confidently
reckon on finding a lard can. Indeed, if you
make camp in the West or South where some
have camped before you, you may find carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
preserved the coffee can used by the last
party. All America is camping out in the
summer, so it is a simple matter to find the
black patch of some one else’s erstwhile sleeping
pitch.</p>

<p>However, I dislike the places where people
have been before, their orange peel and biscuit
wrappings, their trampled grass and
jaded scrub. Give me a virginal patch of
woodland or moorland, or a happy grassy
corner of the long dusty road, and there startle
the earwigs and the birds with the crackle of
a first bonfire. Therefore, I consider it ideal
to take a coffeepot with you, a metal one that
gets blacker and blacker as you go along. It
can best be carried outside the knapsack, angling
from the center strap and resting in the
hollow between the bulging pockets.</p>

<p>I had forgotten the enamel mug, the knife
and the spoon. But you must not. Do not
carry a fork; it is unnecessary. A small
enamel plate is useful. Pepper and salt mixed
to taste may be carried in a little bag. Some
sort of safe box for butter is to be recommended.
Take plenty of old handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
or worst quality new ones; they come in useful.
Remember a glove for taking the coffeepot
off the fire. If you do not you will be
burning all your handkerchiefs, your hat, your
shirt, or anything else that you may be tempted
to use. There are occasions when the coffeepot
seems to get almost red hot before it boils.
There are giddy moments when it loses its
balance and will topple over and spill its precious
contents unless you are ready to dash in
with gloved hand to save it.</p>

<p>For the rest of the contents of your knapsack
you will be guided by your special desires
and aims. Loaded and bulging in the morning,
it will gradually feel lighter and look more
shapely as movement sorts the various things
into their best positions. At night you turn
out many things and use what remains as a
pillow. Some carry a pillow, but it is too
bulky. An air pillow is not to be despised,
but it generally seems to let you down during
the night. Your knapsack will grudge being
left in the dew. It will feel happier with your
head resting upon it.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER FOUR</p>

<p class="c sp lp">CLOTHES</p>


<p class="c">1. <span class="smcap large">Attire</span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>EEDY knife grinder,” said the poet,
“your hat has got a hole in it, and so
have your breeches.” That was not necessary.
You should carry a housemaid’s tidy, or whatever
it may be called, the tiny compendium of
needles and thread sometimes offered upon
hotel dressing tables, and sew up the holes.
I fear the knife grinder’s hat was of felt, a
broken billycock hat, but we tramps have nothing
to do with felt hats. The bowlers and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
derbys and the trilbys are not our style. There
was a time when men tramped in shovel hats,
and I can see Parson Adams trudging along,
his lank locks crowned with this lugubrious
headgear. And Abraham Lincoln walked
abroad in his rusty topper. But we have
changed all that. We tramp in tweed hats or
caps or without hats at all. We do not feel
superior, but we know we are more comfortable.</p>

<p>Also we no longer wear cravats. In fact,
a collar and tie may be secreted in a pocket of
the knapsack to be unwillingly put on when
it is necessary to visit a post office or a bank,
a priest, or the police. But otherwise we go
forth with free necks and throats, top button
of shirt preferably undone.</p>

<p>And we do not tramp in spats or gaiters,
nor in fancy waistcoats. The waistcoat is an
article of attire which can be cheerfully eliminated
as entirely unwanted. Undervests also
are rather <i>de trop</i>. There are many things a
man can shed. I am not qualified to say what
a woman can do without, but she needs no hat
with feathers, no hatpin. As I think of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
in the wilderness it seems to me she can get
rid of everything she commonly wears with the
exception perhaps of a hair net, and then dress
herself afresh in “rational attire.” The green
and brown misses in the “lovely garnish of
boys” are now so familiar in the United States
that it is almost superfluous to describe them.
A khaki blouse and knickers, green putties or
stockings, and a stout pair of shoes are almost
everything; very simple, very practical, and
if one must think of looks while on tramp, not
unbecoming.</p>

<p>Materials are more important than shapes.
A homespun, a tweed, a cord, are better than
flannel or serge or shoddy cloth. Tramping
is destructive of material; sun, rain, camp-fire
sparks, and hot smoke seem to reduce the
resistance of cloth very rapidly. After a
month, a sort of dry rot will show itself, and
as you go through a wood every rotten stick
or tiny thorn you happen to touch will tear
a tatter in your trousers. It can be annoying
and amusing. “When I am tired of looking
at the view I look at your trousers,” said
Lindsay to me, in the Rockies, he in the virtuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
superiority of green corduroy; I in old
clothes which I thought I might as well wear
out on tramp. I certainly wore them out: in
fact, we had to turn from the wilds towards
civilization, and the poet bought me a ready-to-wear
pair of cowboy’s bags.</p>

<p>But workmen’s trousers, suspended by
workmen’s braces, are the best. Braces
marked “For Policemen and Firemen” are
sold in the United States. They are undoubtedly
stout and will stand the strain of many
jumps. You will have a cosy feeling of nothing
defective in your straps, a feeling akin to
that of a good conscience—much to be desired.</p>

<p>What remains? A jacket. It may as well
be a tweed one with half-a-dozen roomy
pockets. I once saw a character reader at a
fair who said: “Show me your hat and I will
tell you who you are.” He had plenty to
guide him. I gave him mine. He said:
“You, sir, are a thinker. Your thoughts have
been oozing out of your head and have spoilt
an excellent lining.” He held my hat up to
the crowd. “This is the hat,” said he, “of a
man who buys at the best shop, but wears his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
hat a very long while. He is both proud and
economical, and is probably a Scotsman.”</p>

<p>Had I taken off my jacket he could probably
have told me a good deal more; made
bulgy with books, yet pinched by the clips of
fountain pens, ink-stained, wine-stained, sun-bleached
and rain-washed, fretted by camp-fire
sparks, frayed and yet not torn by envious
thorns; the whole well stretched, well slept
in, well tramped in. Other parts of one’s attire
wear out, come and go, but the jacket
remains, granted a good sound indestructible
jacket.</p>

<p>Such a jacket is warm wear. No, not in the
morning, not for some hours after sunrise;
not in the evening, not during the twilight
hours. During the heat of the day if you wish
you can take it off and, tying it into a neat
bundle, fix it to the knapsack. It is pleasant
to have the air break fresh on one’s perspiring
chest. But the warm jacket is your friend,
and after two days’ out of home you understand
it. The stout jacket stands by you
in the hours when you need support. You
soon get used to its weight, and its thickness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
helps to bed the knapsack between the
shoulders.</p>

<p>Carlyle wrote a book on clothes, the inwardness
of which was that man, the straggling
bifurcate animal, discovered in Eden that he
was really ugly and a shame to be seen, and he
has been trying to hide himself ever since, in
fig leaves and phrases, phylacteries and philosophies.
That shall provide the tramp’s motto:
a fig leaf and a phrase. But, oh, Sartor, oh,
Mr. Mallaby-Deeley, a stout fig leaf!</p>


<p class="c">2. <span class="smcap large">Motley</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Invest me in my motley; give me leave to speak my
mind.... Motley’s the only wear.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The privilege of the Court Fool is that he
can tell the plain ordinary truth to the King,
even with the executioner standing by, ax in
hand, and risk not his head. But he must be
wearing his cap and bells. Let him come but
dressed as a courtier and make the same
painful jest, and the headsman will step forth
to relieve him of his poor-quality thinking
piece. The Greek who was employed to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
his Alexander after each glorious triumph that
he too must die, must have worn some shred of
motley. You cannot say that sort of thing
without the dress which liberates. It was the
same with Diogenes. He got in so many home
truths in an intolerant age because he lived in
a tub. That tub was his motley. Our tramps’
gear is ours.</p>

<p>There are clothes which rob you of your liberty,
and other clothes which give it you again.
In the sinister garb called morning dress you
are a close prisoner of civilization; but in the
tramp’s morning dress you do not need to
“mind your step.” Oh, the difference between
one who has worn silk in the Temple and the
same man lying in a cave in smoke-scented
tweeds. Of course, it takes some time to break
him down. He is still wearing a shadow topper
and invisible cutaway coat weeks after he
has started into the wilds. The same with
a lady of fashion; she puts a hat over the
glory of her hair to hide the primitive Eve—she
will be still thinking of this false headgear
long after she has changed into a forest
nymph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Motley has a double advantage not used by
Shakespeare in his admirable clownings. It
not only perhaps enables a man to jest
shrewdly with the prince; it enables a prince,
if he will put it on, to talk freely with an ordinary
poor man. The cat can look at the King
and the King can look at the cat.</p>

<p>Class is the most disgusting institution of
civilization, because it puts barriers between
man and man. The man from the first-class
cabin cannot make himself at home in the
steerage. He can have conversations with his
fellow man down there, but fellow man will
be standing to attention like private in presence
of officer, or standing defiant like prisoner
in presence of a condemnatory court. It
is not the fault of the bottom dog, the proletarian.
He scents a manner. Your bearing
cannot be adjusted to equality. You are not
on the level with him. You cannot rid your
voice of its kind note. “Damn it, don’t be
kind to me,” say the eyes of the third-class passenger.
But you cannot get rid of that absurd,
unwanted, kind look—that “tell me, my dear
man” expression.</p>

<p>Yes, whatever he replies will seem a little bit
irrelevant, like the answers to the visiting rector
going the round of his parish, he having the
next drag hunt on his mind.</p>

<p>But in the tramps’ motley you can say what
you like, ask what questions you like, free from
the taint of class.</p>

<p>It also puts you right with regard to yourself.
You see yourself as others see you, and
that is a refreshing grace wafted in upon an
opinionated mind. The freedom of speech and
action and judgment which it gives you will
breed that boldness of bearing which, after all,
is better than mere good manners. It allows
you to walk on your heels as well as on your
toes, and to eat without a finicking assortment
of forks. It aids your digestion of truth and
of food, and aids nutrition as good air does
good porridge. All that highfalutin’ advice
which Kipling wrote in “If” may be left in its
glum red lettering pasted on your bedroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
wall, if you will only put on your tramp’s
motley.</p>

<p>“What must I do to inherit eternal life?”
The answer to that question is not adequately
stated in that “If” of talking to mobs without
losing your virtue and to Kings without losing
the common touch, or in the “If” of making a
heap of all your winnings and staking them in
a game of pitch and toss. The answer of the
Evangel is Take up the Cross and Follow Me,
which may be interpreted indulgently for our
purpose here: Take up thy staff and the
common burden for thy shoulders, the motley
of the pilgrim and the tramp.</p>

<p class="c sp lp">CARRYING MONEY</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>UT money in thy purse,” is often given
to the young man as a jewel of wisdom.
But we give the contrary advice: take it out.
The less you carry the more you will see, the
less you spend the more you will experience.
Of course, if you have a strong enough will to
resist temptation you can carry what you like,
but even then you are at the disadvantage of
being worth a robber’s attention.</p>

<p>I sometimes pride myself that I set out for
Jerusalem with the Russian pilgrims having
ten pounds, and that I brought back five of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
pounds to Russia. The most I paid for lodging
in Jerusalem was three farthings a day.
Had I quit for a hotel I should have lost most
of the experience of the pilgrimage. When I
made my study of the emigrants to America
I went steerage and came back steerage. I
stayed in a workman’s lodging house in New
York and I tramped to Chicago on less than a
dollar a day. Of course it is very expensive in
America, always was, unless you care to work
your way. For my part, I think working one’s
way even more expensive.</p>

<p>A shilling a day ought to be ample for
tramping in any part of the world—if you
cook on your own camp fire and sleep out. But
America is an exception. There you will need
three-parts of a dollar. In Europe generally,
after the War, one needs to consider the currency
situation. The Tyrol has been a place
of cheap food and wine; now it is much dearer.
France and Italy, on the other hand, are
cheaper.</p>

<p>It is well to carry notes of low denominations,
as it is almost always difficult to get
change in the country. If you have a larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
note, a reserve, to take you, let us say, by boat
or train somewhere, at some point of your adventure,
or to bring you home, it is as well to
sew it in your jacket lining. It is a mistake
to put it in your knapsack or in a pocket of a
shirt. Once I put a five-pound note in a secret
pocket of a shirt and forgot all about it till
after I received my linen one day, washed and
ironed, from a peasant girl. Suddenly I remembered,
and feverishly picked up the shirt
and went to the secret pocket, the girl smiling
at me as I did so. The note was there,
fresh and crisp. I was astonished. “You
washed and ironed this bit of paper?” I
asked. “No,” she said simply, “I found it
in and took it out. But I put it back after
ironing.”</p>

<p>In America it is as well to carry travelers’
checks, as they can be cashed even in a small
village, and they are safer than notes. In Europe
such checks are difficult to cash except in
large cities. They are unfamiliar to the
bankers of provincial towns. Even in large
towns you may have to wander from bank to
bank seeking a correspondent of the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
bank from which you have taken the traveler’s
check.</p>

<p>A good plan is to have five-pound notes sent
to you by registered post by a bank at the time
at which you are likely to require them. They
can be sent <i>poste restante</i>, but it is unwise to
leave the packet too long unclaimed, as in
some countries they send back letters to sender
after a week. Money can be sent by wire
in this way. Money can also be sent by a
bank in response to a wire if you have
arranged a code signature before leaving
home. This is a very simple matter if you
are bad enough tramp to have a balance
intact.</p>

<p>After two months, or less, in the open, living
the life of a tramping hermit, you are likely,
upon occasion, to have a joyous reaction
towards excess. And this may express itself
in a gay and giddy week-end, in hotels and
restaurants and places of music and dance.
You may spend more on a romp than you do
on the tramp. Round and round the market
place the monkey chased the weasel! You
are that monkey never catching that weasel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
That’s the way the money goes. Pop goes
the weasel!</p>

<p>Oh, that weasel, that weasel of false heart’s
desire! Haven’t we chased it upon occasion!</p>

<p>Thus sang the banjo in the wilderness. You
lie in the heights of the mountain under the
stars, with empty pockets and empty stomach,
and you look at the many lights, the blent illumination
of the Milky Way, and think—of
Broadway, the Great White Way, burning its
great stream of electricity, burning your candle
and its own.</p>

<p>The spree is not, however, entirely legitimate
to the tramping expedition. Tramping
is first of all a rebellion against housekeeping
and daily and monthly accounts. You may
escape from the spending mania, but first of
all you escape from the inhibition, that is the
word, the inhibition of needing to earn a living.
In tramping you are not earning a living,
but earning a happiness.</p>

<p>There was a verse of poetry of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Ruskin, in his satirical mood, was inordinately
fond:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>As for the bird in the thicket,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Thrush or ouzel in leafy niche,</i></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, ours is the morning concert, without
ticket and without program, without classification
of box or stall. You do not pay as you
enter, nor grumble as you go out. Indeed
there is a very good reason. Performers and
friends of the performers do not pay. You
come as a friend of the thrush, or you are a
thrush yourself. We shall see as we tramp
the woods together which it is. But in any
case the thrush never takes round the hat.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER SIX</p>

<p class="c sp lp">THE COMPANION</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>IVE me a companion of my way, be it
only to mention how the shadows
lengthen as the sun declines,” wrote Hazlitt.
An ideal companion is ideal. However, we
all know that companionship prolonged may
be trying even to good friends. If you live
for some time in the same room with any one
you discover that fact. Indeed, you discover
a good deal about your companion that you
had not suspected before you were intimate,
and he about you. Eventually a cloud no
bigger than a man’s hand becomes a storm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
you quarrel over what seems afterwards to
have been nothing at all. Even man and wife
of ideal choice find that out.</p>

<p>But there is perhaps no greater test of
friendship than going on a long tramp. You
discover to one another all the egoisms and
selfishnesses you possess. You may not see
your own: you see your companion’s faults.
In truth, if you want to find out about a man,
go for a long tramp with him.</p>

<p>Still there are rewards. If you do not
quarrel irreparably and part on the road you
will probably find your friendship greatly increased
by the experience of the wilds together.
I like tramping alone, but a companion
is well worth finding. He will add to
the experience; perhaps double it.</p>

<p>You have naturally long conversations.
You comment on Nature around you, and on
tramping experiences. You talk of books and
pictures, of poems, of people, but above all,
almost inevitably, of yourself. Tramping
makes you self-revelatory. And this is an
enormous boon. If you have patience you will
get to see your friend in a new light; you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
fill in the picture which up to then you have
but vaguely sketched. The richest people in
life are the good listeners. If, however, you
also must talk, must reveal your life, your
heart, your prejudices and passions, it will
often happen that you will express yourself to
yourself, as much as to your friend. Self-confession
is growth of the mind, an enriching
of the consciousness. In talk which seems idle
enough you may be reaching out toward the
infinite.</p>

<p>The early morning tramp is a striving time,
one of reaching out, of vigorous assertions.
The afternoon may mock the morning with
jesting, with ribald songs,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“<i>Songs that make you cough and blow your nose,</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>as Kipling says. But the evening will make
amends. There is a great poetic time after
the camp fire has been lit, the coffee brewed,
the sleeping place laid out. You sit by the
embers as the twilight deepens and talk till the
stars shine brightly upon you. That is the
time of confidences, of tenderness, of melancholy,
of the “might-have-been” and the “if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
only.” You are full of the songs of the birds
to which you have listened all day. Music will
come out again.</p>

<p>But there are many types of companionship:
the two undergraduates <i>en vacance</i>, the
two cronies of the same town, the middle-aged
man and his young disciple, sweethearts, bachelor
girls, father and son, man and wife, friend
and friend.</p>

<p>Young athletes will go to the furthest distance;
lovers the shortest. But the lovers may
be out the longest time. I am inclined to measure
a tramp by the time taken rather than by
the miles. If a hundred miles is covered in a
week it is a longer tramp than if it is rushed
in three days. There is great happiness in
taking a month over it. However, it is hardly
possible to walk less than seven miles a day
if one sleeps out of doors.</p>

<p>A point to make sure about in companionship
is distribution of kit. You do not need
two coffeepots, two sugar bags—a number of
duplicates can be avoided. See your companion
has the right boots. The slower walker
should set the pace. It is absurd for one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
walk the other off his feet just to show what
a walker he is. There is great difference in
walking capacity. Some can do forty miles
a day without turning a hair; many can hardly
keep up fifteen. If your companion breaks
his feet or turns an ankle you may have to wait
some days with him while he recovers. The
first days of tramping are in this respect the
most dangerous. It is so easy to blister the
feet if one marches too far in hot weather.
One or two blisters may be remedied, but there
comes a morning when you cannot get your
boots on.</p>

<p>The best companions are those who make
you freest. They teach you the art of life by
their readiness to accommodate themselves.
After freedom, I enjoy in a companion a well
stocked mind, or observant eyes, or wood lore
of any kind. It is nice sometimes to tramp
with a living book.</p>

<p>Of course, one should carry a notebook or
diary or some broad-margined volume of
poems. You can annotate Keats from your
life on the road. But whether you do that or
merely record the daily life in a page-a-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
journal, you are enriching yourself enormously
by what you can write about.</p>

<p>Lovers, I imagine, will carry no diary.
Their impressionable hearts are the tablets on
which they write. Every one has a tendency
to write down the unforgettable: it is obviously
unnecessary. Loving pairs, however,
seldom take their staffs and their packs and
make for the wild. Even in our free days
they are somewhat afraid of it. But it is to
be recommended as an admirable preparation
for married life. It is a romantic adventure,
but it leads to reality. If you have to carry
your beloved, you will probably have to carry
her for the rest of your life. You cannot tell
till you’ve spent a night in the rain, or lost
the way in the mountains, and eaten all the
food, whether you have both stout hearts and
a readiness for every fate. If not a tramp
before marriage, then a tramp directly after
comes not amiss, a honeymoon spent tramping.
It is an ideal way to begin life. For tramping
is the grammar of living. Few people
learn the grammar—but it is worth while.</p>

<p>There are few more felicitous proposals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
marriage set down in literature than the Autocrat
at the Breakfast Table’s, “Will you take
the long road with me?”</p>

<p>Life <i>à deux</i> is much more of an adventure
than life <i>seul</i>, much more of a tramping
expedition, less of a “carriage forward,”
“fragile,” “lift with care,” and “use no hooks”
affair. One, be it the man, be it the woman,
pulls the other from security. It is a more
difficult way of life; it needs learning.</p>

<p>On the road the weak and strong points of
character are revealed. There are those who
complain, making each mile seem like three;
there are those who have untapped reserves
of cheerfulness, who sing their companions
through the tired hours. But in drawing-rooms,
trains, tennis parties, theater, and
dance hall, they would never show either quality.
The road shows sturdiness, resourcefulness,
pluck, patience, energy, vitality, or per
contra, the lack of these things. It is something
to face the first night together under the
stars, the fears of lurking robbers or wild animals,
fears of the unnamed.</p>

<p>The first night out together of a man and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
his wife is a memorable occasion. You go
back to the primitive, but there is something
very cosy and comfortable about it—the only
man in the world with the only woman. Darkness
settles down upon you in a stranger way
than it does upon man and man. There is
more poetry in the air and in your mind.
More tenderness is enkindled than ceiling and
walls of house ever saw, tenderness of a certain
sheltering care which it is luxurious to
give.</p>

<p>Night is dark and still and intense, and you
can hear two hearts beating while you look
outward and upward, and dimly discern the
passage of bats’ wings in the air.</p>

<p>The first night, however, is seldom without
alarm; the cold wet nose of a hedgehog touching
your beloved’s cheek may cause her to rend
the air with a shriek, a field mouse at her toes
cause her scarcely less alarm. It is good to
pack her in a really capacious sleeping bag;
it excludes rodents. And if you are not too
big you can snuggle into it yourself, if the lady
proves to be nervous and you are on such
terms of fellowship as to make it possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>A night of murmurings and deepening
shadows and freshness, and then, perhaps, of
a gentle rain before dawn, and of glimmerings
of new day and sweetness of wild flowers and
birds’ songs before sunrise. You watch the
boles of the great trees grow into stateliness in
the twilight, and the night is over. With an
arm round your fair one you go to the point
where in orange and scarlet the great friend of
all the living is lifting himself once more out
of the east to show us the way of life.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>

<p class="c sp lp">WHITHER AWAY?</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE principle motive of the wander-spirit
is curiosity—the desire to know what is
beyond the next turning of the road, and to
probe for oneself the mystery of the names of
the places in maps. In a subconscious way
the born wanderer is always expecting to come
on something very wonderful—beyond the
horizon’s rim. The joys of wandering are
often balanced by the pains; but there is something
which is neither joy nor pain which
makes the desire to wander or explore almost
incurable in many human beings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>The child experiences his first wander-thrill
when he is taken to places where he has never
been before. I remember from the age of nine
a barefoot walk with my mother along the
Lincolnshire sands from Sutton to Skegness,
and the romantic and strange sights on the
way. What did we not build out of that adventure?
And who does not remember the
pleasurable thrill, the pleasure that’s all but
pain, of being lost in a wood, or in a strange
countryside, and meeting some crazy individual
who humored the idea by apostrophizing
a little brook in this style: “I am now marching
upon the banks of the mighty Congo”?
The imagination wishes to be stirred with the
romance of places, and is stirred. In a great
city like London or New York, even though
living there, certainly I for one am homesick;
not for a home and an armchair, but for a rolling
road and a stout pair of boots, and my own
stick fire by the roadside at dawn, and the old
pot which is slow to boil.</p>

<p>“Where,” I am asked, “would you go
a-tramping now if you were absolutely fancy-free
and passports and Bolsheviks were unknown?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
It would probably be in Russia,
where I have vagabondized over thousands of
miles already. I should like to resume my six-thousand-mile
journey southwest to northwest,
which was interrupted by the War in
August, 1914. But, alas, the Moscow of the
Bolsheviks does not encourage adventure of
that kind.</p>

<p>Again, I’d like to buy a boat at Perm and
slip down to the Petchora River, and go with
the stream thousands of miles north, selling
the boat to the Samoyedes at the mouth of the
river, thence tramping perhaps by the tundra
roads or sledging it to Mesen. What a romance,
what a journey, as it seems to me now,
in complete inexperience of it!</p>

<p>Or I’d like to take a party of literary men
across the Altai, and in a verdant valley
live for half a year without letters and
newspapers, and each write his own book,
express his own peculiar happiness in his own
words.</p>

<p>Or I’d like to plunge south from Verney,
in Seven-Rivers-Land, or from Kashgar, and
climb to the mountain passes into India; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
as I think of it a sense of the last poem of
Davidson creeps into the memory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Alone I climb</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>The ragged path that leads me out of Time.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So much for Russia. I’d love to tramp the
whole length of Japan, and peer into all the
ways of the modern Japanese. There, however,
speaks another interest, and that is not
so much to explore strange lands as to explore
strange people. Life teaches the wanderer
that peoples are extra pages to geography, and
the fascination can at times be irresistible.
You long to be familiar with Russians, Frenchmen,
Germans, Chinamen, Arabs, Americans,
and the rest. And it takes you afield, it takes
you far, far away from 1, Alpha Villas, or the
sweet shady side of Pall Mall.</p>

<p>I’ve long wished to wander for years in the
tents of the nomads of the Central Mongolian
Plain. I came on them accidentally, tramping
in Turkestan; surely among the most interesting
peoples in the world, and the oldest, with
customs of the most intense human interest.
Nothing less than a year with them would do;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and that means a year without civilization, for
no postman seeks the wandering tents of the
Kirghis and the Kalmouk.</p>

<p>I should like also to pursue a study which
I once began of the monasteries of the Copts,
and tramp in the Sahara desert, to follow the
clues of early Christianity up the Nile from
Alexandria and the Thebaid, and I would
make some study of Abyssinian Christianity
in its native haunts. Or, on the other side of
the world, I’d like to tramp the communal
estate of the Dukhobors, of which I obtained
a glimpse in 1922 in western Canada. Or I’d
like just now to tramp as a beggar through
the heart of the new Ireland.</p>

<p>These, and many other fascinating adventures,
haunt the mind like Maeterlinck’s souls
of the unborn children in that charming drama
of the ideal—“The Betrothal.” If I don’t do
them this time on earth, and can’t do them,
friends are apt to say: “Well, next time.”
One lifetime will hardly suffice to find out all
there is to know and to enjoy in the world
and in man.</p>

<p>Vachel Lindsay, with whom I enjoyed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
wonderful six weeks when we crossed Glacier
Park, going by compass, and passed the frontier
between the United States and Canada, is
eager for a resumption of the trail. Next time
it shall be Mount McKinley in Alaska, or
Crater Lake, in the far northwest of the
States. Perhaps some day I’ll go. Only recently
I received from him, by one post, six
long letters and a packet of coffee from Going-to-the-Sun
Mountain. “Come at once,”
said Vachel. But I was in Finland at the time.
Otherwise I’d have flung off for Alaska or
Crater Lake. The difficulty is to say “No”
to such suggestions. It would be a traveling
more with Nature than with man—through
enormous wildernesses. Imagination could
draw a wonderful picture of what such places
would be like, but there is one crude unmannerly
truth that the traveler always comes
upon in the course of his experience of new
places, and that is, that imagination, though
very charming, is nearly always wrong.
Knowledge of living detail shows the world to
be full of the unexpected, the unanticipated,
the unimagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>There is a type of tramping which belongs
more to the future; a new type, and an even
more fascinating one, and that is the taking of
cross sections of the world, the cutting across
all roads and tracks, the predispositions of
humdrum pedestrians, and making a sort of
virginal way across the world. This can be
tried first of all as a haphazard tramp—a setting
out to walk without the name of any place
you want to get to. Hence the zigzag walk,
of which I write later. Keep taking the first
turning on the left and the next on the right,
and see where it leads you. In towns this
gives you a most alluring adventure. You get
into all manner of obscure courts and alleys
you would never have noticed in the ordinary
way. But in the country, <i>beaucoup zigzag</i>,
as they say in France, does not work. You
get tied up in a hopeless tangle of lanes which
go back upon themselves. As a result of a
week’s tramping you may find yourself only
two steps from the place you started from.
You feel like a lost ant that, after infinite
trouble, has got back to the heap. It is dull
to be an ant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>In the country a real cross section and
haphazard adventurous tramp is one which can
be known as “Trespasser’s Walk.” You take
with you a little compass, decide to go west or
east, as fancy favors, and then keep resolutely
to the guidance of the magnetic needle.
It takes you the most extraordinary way, and
shows what an enormous amount of the face
of the earth is kept away from the feet of
ordinary humanity by the fact of “private
property.” On the other side of the hedge
that skirts the public way is an entirely different
atmosphere and company. In ten minutes
in our beautiful Sussex you can find
yourself as remote from ordinary familiar
England as if you were in the midst of a great
reservation. And you may tramp a whole day
upon occasion without meeting a single human
being.</p>

<p>I want to do it in Russia some time—tramp
across her by the compass, visit the hamlets
which are five miles from the road, visit those
which are fifty from the road, a hundred and
fifty from the road. In that way I should find
a Russia as yet unknown, unrevealed. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
would be a strange and fantastic quest of happiness.</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in it,” I can hear the stay-at-home
repeat. And if he came with me it
would not be long before he parted company
and went back. “There’s no sense in going
further.” And he is quite right if he doesn’t
hear the explorer’s whisper in his heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>One everlasting whisper, day and night, repeated—so:</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>“Something hidden. Go and find it. Go and look behind the Ranges—</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Something lost behind the Ranges. Lost and waiting for you. Go!”</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Japanese question to the Polar explorer:
“What did you find when you got to
the Pole?” is a foolish one. You may bring
nothing back in your hands from an expedition,
but you have garnered within. You have
garnered for yourself and also for others. It
is always worth while to quit for a time the
rabbit hutches of civilization and do something
which stay-at-home folk call flying in the face
of fortune. “Is it not comfortable enough
where you are?” they ask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>However, tramping, as I am writing of it,
is not Polar exploration, nor footing it along
the rocky ways of the mountains to Lhasa. It
is a smaller, gentler, matter. It is merely
accepting the call of Nature; taking those two
weeks which Wells described in his Modern
Utopia—and taking more. But it matters
greatly where one chooses to go. Some countries
are better than others, some districts
better than other districts.</p>

<p>England cannot be said to be excellent
tramping country; very good for a walking
tour where one seeks an inn each night, but
not good for a tramp in which one hopes to
sleep <i>à la belle étoile</i>. Even when the weather
is fine the dews are heavy. In the occasional
dry, hot summers which occur it is however,
delightful to adventure forth in the West
Country or in Cumberland, or even in the
Highlands. One or two jaunts are very attractive,
for instance, to tramp the old Roman
Wall from Carlisle to Wallsend at Newcastle,
or to tramp the Scottish border from Berwick
to the Solway. One passes over remarkably
wild and desolate country. I think especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of the track from Jedburgh to Newcastleton,
and a forlorn district called, if I
remember rightly, Knot of the Hill, which,
however, is very much of the hill. One meets
upon occasion uncouth, friendly mountain
shepherds with plenty of philosophy in them.
There are some wild tramps in Wales, especially
in the marches. The Shropshire border
is most interesting. If, however, one dives
westward for places such as Dinas Mawddy or
Dolgelly, one should take provisions for a
couple of days. It is easy to lose yourself, and
when you come upon people they speak only
Welsh, and one has some trouble in making
oneself understood. Dartmoor and western
Ireland and the mountains and coastways of
Donegal afford remarkable scope for adventurers
with pack on back.</p>

<p>One ought to be very careful in Great Britain
about wayside fires. Even when one is
careful to put them out thoroughly with water
before leaving one is apt to get into trouble
with the farmers, the police, etc. One should
also remember that if found sleeping behind
haystacks, or in barns, one is liable to be haled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
before the justice and charged with vagrancy.
Not that the tramp need be ashamed, when
motorists appear there in strings charged with
obstruction and speeding and the like. As a
practical detail, however, it may be mentioned
that sleepers are very rarely discovered.</p>

<p>America is, of course, the tramp’s paradise,
a country made by tramps. I do not mean the
hoboes which infest the railroads to-day, but
the Johnny Appleseeds of time past, who went
exploring beyond the horizon and the sunset.
The first thing to be said about the New
World is its enormous stretch and variety.
Many people have walked the three thousand
miles from New York to San Francisco. I
even came across a woman who had done it in
high-heeled boots. It is no novelty. A more
difficult transcontinental jaunt would be the
four thousand miles of the Unguarded Line—the
frontier of Canada and the United States.
This is a good literary expedition, and any one
who did it and described it well would make his
name. My friend Wilfrid Ewart had it in
mind to do, and he went prospectively over the
details of such a vagabondage. But he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
unfortunately killed in Mexico. Such a tramp
would not be confined to frontier posts, but
should be crisscross, now in the Republic, now
in the Empire.</p>

<p>Another tramp which has seldom been done,
except by laborers, is to follow the wheat harvest
north from Texas. The harvesting starts
in June in the South, and great gangs of harvesters
work northward with the summer.
This implies a readiness to work in the fields.
It is arduous, but a great experience. You
garner wheat: you garner gold. If you take
lifts when offered you may get all the way to
Oregon by September and find the corn still
standing there.</p>

<p>In America, however, the roads are killing.
You can only tramp in the early hours of the
morning and the cool of the evening—at least,
in summer. The noontide is too hot, the many
cars throw up too much dust. Cross-country
tramping is much happier and provides more
adventures.</p>

<p>But the man in the car is much more hospitable
in America than in any other part of the
world. When tired of some waterless, treeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
countryside, you can come on to the highway,
hail a passing car, and be taken a long step
further forward. The leisured and educated
Americans do not tramp for pleasure and find
some difficulty in understanding it. There is
a well-known motto: <i>Why walk if you can
ride?</i> And Americans without automobiles
make their more fortunate brothers carry
them. A hand wave from a pedestrian brings
a car to a halt and you jump in. Journeys
have been made from New York to Los
Angeles, Boston to New Orleans, “stepping
cars,” all the way. It is not to be recommended,
however, as it is an abuse of a delightful
hospitality.</p>

<p>Still, unless you are studying American
civilization, it is hardly worth while to tramp
from town to town. The wildernesses are so
much more interesting. It is worth while for
any one thinking out a novel walk to apply to
the Department of Forests and National
Parks at Washington. A National Park, conventional
as it sounds, may easily prove to be
a reserve of territory as extensive as an English
county. They are commonly referred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
by propagandists as “vast natural playgrounds”—but
as yet they are but little used.
Yellowstone Park is the only one which is
visited by great numbers of people. The
others are in nowise overrun. Indeed, the
railway journeys to them are generally so
long that the masses of the eastern cities cannot
profit by them. There are two specially
marvelous ones, Sequoia and Yosemite, notable
for their trees; the highest and the oldest
trees in the world are to be found in these
primeval wildernesses.</p>

<p>The Grand Canyon can afford at least a
week’s walking. It is a mistake to go down
it on horse or mule, and when down in the
depths there is a marvelous journey for the
pedestrian along the rocky flank of the fast-running
Colorado River. If at Grand Canyon
in August it is well to visit the Hopi Indians
and see the Snake Dance. However, it is
really better to visit the Canyon later in the
year. At Christmas it is delightful. At midsummer
it is really too oppressive down below.
When I went down there was snow above and
soft vernal airs three thousand feet under,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
spring flowers in bloom, and one could sit
happily by one’s wood fire in the afternoon
sunshine.</p>

<p>Tramping in the South of the United States
is very pleasant in autumn and spring, especially
in Florida and Alabama. In the summer
it is too hot and the mosquitoes unusually
thick. A very interesting November tramp
is from Atlanta, the largest city in Georgia,
to Savannah on the coast. In this way you
can follow, as I did, the track of Sherman’s
army in its famous march to the sea.</p>

<p>But there are places less far afield than
these. There is hardly any wilder country
anywhere than in upper New York State. A
tramp through New England is likely to be
congenial to most Englishmen: the people are
so much nearer to the English. Canada also
presents enormous fields for pleasure tramping,
or for tramping which is almost exploration.
The far Northwest especially is wild
and little traversed.</p>

<p>Europe, however, has equally strong claims
on those who tramp, being even more diversified
than is America. The language difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
is the chief drawback. There are a hundred or
so tongues. Customs and laws are also bewildering.
Still, the best way to see the Pyrenees
or the Alps is pack on back. The charming
works of Hilaire Belloc on the “Path to
Rome” and the Pyrenees are memorials of
excellent tramping in Europe.</p>

<p>A pilgrimage from inn to inn in France,
especially going south through the wine country,
is utterly pleasant. One dispenses with a
coffeepot in these parts, a liter bottle is better.
Fill it with the <i>vin du pays</i> wherever you go;
a bottle of Chablis in the village of Chablis,
a bottle of Nuits St. Georges in the village of
Nuits St. Georges, a bottle of Pommard at
Pommard, identifying the country by the wine
of wayside inns. It is well to taste and try
what any countryside, town, or hostelry is
famous for, be it Creole gumbo or stuffed peppers,
be it even snails, even frogs’ legs. I remember
in younger days the disgust of the
waiter in a little hotel opposite Chartres
Cathedral when I rejected a plateful of snails
which, with a clatter, he had put before me—a
flagon of red wine, a chunk of bread, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
plateful of Roman snails. I said “No! Take
them away!”</p>

<p>The waiter shrugged his shoulders. <i>Que
diable!</i> If I didn’t want snails why did I come
to that hotel? Snails were their specialty.
However, I confess now I have eaten snails.
The first time was at Pont de Vaux, near
Mâcon of Burgundy fame. The snails came
on as a third course at the Hôtellerie de la
Renaissance, cleverly disguised, and before I
knew it I was saying, “I like these; I wonder
what they are!”</p>

<p>They were purveyed upon a silver tray, or
nickel, I suppose; they had been taken out of
their shells and put into tiny pots, one snail
one pot. There were a dozen or so tiny pots
on the tray, each no more than half an inch
across the top, and in each a snail floated in a
little bath of melted butter and spice. There
was a slender two-pronged fork which looked
like a toothpick, and you ate the snail with
that.</p>

<p>Very tasty! Very novel! Perhaps that was
how the Romans ate them. Perhaps in ancient
Egypt they ate them in that way, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
are the original fleshpots. Be that as it may,
I felt much amused and intrigued and turned
with a friendly gesture to my bottle of local
Mâcon. I was more pro-French after that,
having got over a prejudice, I could no longer
say, “Disgusting people; they eat snails!”</p>

<p>France is a delightful country for a spring
escapade. Go South and stay in the country
inns, and disenchant the Northern seriousness!
It’s a great idea. Go out from Paris to Fontainebleau,
where the birds are singing in
choirs in the silvery lichened trees. You can
sprawl at your length in the sun in May. It
is cold sleeping out, but there are inns. You
will walk amid wild daffodils and budding
hyacinths. Summer is coming north to meet
you at Joigny or Dijon. You enter the Côte
d’Or country and spectacular stone villages
among green hills. From Dijon by red-earth
vineyards whence the well cut vines are sprouting
an elemental eye-placating green. Your
eyes need placating after the dreary North
with its cities and industries. The vineyards
have low stone walls which incidentally make
excellent seats for the wanderer on which to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
munch his bread and Camembert and stand his
bottle of Burgundy. You come to Beaune, a
name on a bottle, on a wine list, now a place
well established in your mind and heart. So
also Pommard, Volnay, Mersault, Nuits,
Mâcon, to mention but a few.</p>

<p>It is a longish distance, but another journey
or a continuation might be from Lyons along
the banks of the Rhône or eastward to Lake
Geneva and Switzerland. It is very hot on
the Rhône, but there is an added interest in the
old Roman cities you pass through. Avignon
might be your center, and from Avignon there
are delightful pilgrimages to the fountain of
Vaucluse, where Petrarch and Laura met, to
Tarascon, the byword for obscurity in France,
to famous Arles and its amphitheater. But
certainly the most wild and delightful tramp
would be over the mountains by compass to
Cannes, through untraversed and solitary
Provence. This can be done in later summer.
For although it is extremely hot on the
Riviera, the whole way there is at a height,
and one drops down to the coast by a precipitous
road from the perfume factories of Grasse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Tramping expeditions of even more beauty
can be made on the French side of the Pyrenees,
in the country of the Basques. Pious
Catholics may be inclined to make for Lourdes
and will encounter the sick in body going for
health, and perhaps coming in the opposite direction,
rejoicing cripples who have been made
whole. Whether credulous or incredulous, the
tramp will find Lourdes a religious curiosity
well worth approaching in the spirit of a true
pilgrim on foot. A tramp from Biarritz to
Carcassonne, across the ankle of the Franco-Iberian
peninsula holds many picturesque
sights of strange people and of feudal towns.
But mountainous Nature will rule the hearts
of all those who come under the influence of
the sublime. This is delightful country for
sleeping out, provided mosquito netting be
carried. Inns, however, are not so numerous,
and one should be prepared to make one’s own
coffee on one’s own brushwood fire.</p>

<p>Spain, despite some pleasant volumes recording
walking tours, is really untouched.
It is a remarkable country, and the people,
the most conservative and delightful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Europe, look somewhat askance upon Bohemians.
There are tens of thousands of beggars
who are accepted as philosophically as flies in
summer, but the man in tweeds with knapsack
on his back is regarded as some sort of strange
wild animal. One is almost bound to be called
upon to explain oneself to the police, and to
find oneself described officially as a vagrant.
Jan and Cora Gordon, two delightful vagabonds,
got over the difficulty by carrying
guitars, and they were understood as itinerant
musicians. In the end, because they played so
well, they won over the affections of many
somber Spaniards. Among other tramping
friends of mine, I ought to mention Mr. Forse,
the tramping vicar of Southborne, who has
made several tours on foot in Spain and issues
his impressions as supplements to his parish
magazine. I often envied him his experiences.</p>

<p>It was my impression in Spain that it is
not wise to wear tweeds. Black is the accepted
color for all people. All respectable beggars
wear black. On the other hand, state visits are
also made in black. With regard to the climate
of Spain, it is easy to be deceived. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
much colder than most people think. Northern
Spain is mostly elevated plateau and is
exposed to bitter winds in the spring. Andalusia,
however, and the South generally, is
serene and warm, hot even, but subject to unpleasant
dust storms. Incidentally, it may be
mentioned that the easiest way to get to Spain
is via Southampton and Gibraltar. The railway
journey from France is apt to be very
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>After these two countries, northern Italy,
Switzerland, and Germany come naturally to
mind. Of these, by far the cheapest is northern
Italy, and there is more untrodden ground.
It is well to take passports for Austria as well,
so as to be free of the Austrian Tyrol if you
wish to enter. Austria, however, as a result of
the War, lost a great deal of magnificent territory
to Italy, and there is plenty of room in
the latter country. Southern Germany is, of
course, very fine, and not inhospitable, though
the cost of provisions has gone up prodigiously.
Perhaps that will be remedied—as one
remembers Germany in the old days as one of
the cheapest countries for travel in the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Bavaria is, however, still Bavaria, and if beer
attract, the brown brau is as good as ever.
The Bavarians were the only Germans who
did not <i>Gott-strafe</i> England, America, and
the rest, and they are quite pleasant neighbors.
The Germans themselves are good
walkers, love rucksacks, and the tramp will
attract no unpleasant curiosity as in Spain.
Switzerland may best be enjoyed afoot. It
is common ground for the walkers of all
nationalities—a League of Nations center for
those who love God’s handiwork in Nature.
It is, however, a rendezvous for the lazier type
of tourist, and the “lounge lizard” is apt to set
the pace for all. It is dangerous to spend
more than one night consecutively in one of the
large hotels or tourist round-ups. It is a
desecration of one’s opportunities to use them
for dancing and gentle promenades. The
program of the visitor to Switzerland is apt to
be a little unambitious. People go with heaps
of luggage and find themselves tied to it, returning
inevitably to it even from delightful
daily expeditions, like cows from pasture.
The end of a happy day should be the stepping-stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
to one still happier. A fortnight
or three weeks spent going continuously with
sunset and dawn joined by your resting place
in the hills has a larger content that the equivalent
days spent going out to a certain point
and then returning to a hotel.</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia is also a country of athleticism,
and one encounters good will there at
every point. There is a good deal of delightful
ground, especially in the Carpathians. It
is rougher going than in France, but the people
you meet are simpler. More rations need
to be carried as villages are further apart and
are apt to have less in them than one might
imagine. Here are few canned goods. But
there is plenty of good fruit. An expedition
well worth making is to Ushorod, in the long
narrow strip of territory inhabited by the
Carpathian Russians.</p>

<p>As regards the rest of Southern Europe,
conditions are frequently difficult. The Balkans
are bare and sun-beaten, and largely uncivilized.
There is plenty of scope for
adventure, especially in Albania, where an
armed guard is usually required. Dalmatia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
is extremely interesting, especially the primitive
Croats living in the interior. But the
country is mostly treeless and subject to the
southern sun and the Sirocco. Early morning
is the best time for walking. It is often
very cool then—but there is little shelter from
the noontide ardor. Spalato and Ragusa are
excellent starting points, especially the former.
Montenegro has very interesting people and
the country is obscure enough to please the
stoutest adventurer.</p>

<p>I have written considerably in my books
concerning tramping in Russia and Siberia.
I have been over many thousands of miles of
Russia afoot. The happiest times were in
the Caucasus, by the Gorge of Dariel road,
over the Cross Pass, or by the Rion valley over
Mamison, or on the Caucasian shore of the
Black Sea. When it is too hot to live in a
house in a town, it is heaven on the mountains.
Since the War, and the Revolution, the Caucasus
has, unfortunately, become much more
dangerous for travelers of all kinds. The
tribes are warlike, and have been badly treated
by Bolsheviks and Europeans in general.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Robbers are merciless. Pacification should,
however, succeed within the next ten years,
and the Caucasus become open again. Weapons
are not of much use to a tramp in these
parts. If he carry a revolver he should be
secretive about it—for a revolver is a great
lure. You are almost certain to be robbed if
it is known you have a revolver—for the revolver’s
sake. It is best to go unarmed and
match intelligence against force when necessary.
The native horsemen will be found to
be of a brow-beating kind, carrying perchance
several mortal weapons. It is best to meet
them face to face—but smiling—never let
them get you scared. They may want to turn
you back or force you to work in their fields.
But a smiling answer turneth away wrath, and
it is well to keep them talking and watch for
your chance to escape. It should be remarked
that the scope for tramping is not great before
the middle of May, or after the middle of
October. The passes, the lowest of which is
over nine thousand feet, fill up with snow;
you get into whirling blizzards and lose the
only trail. On Mamison, especially, it is easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
to go wrong, as it is extremely desolate. I
crossed once before the snows had melted, an
experience never to be forgotten or to be repeated.</p>

<p>It is better in the Caucasus to provide for
sleeping out. There are inns, <i>dukhans</i>, bedless,
dirty, and you can obtain hospitality in
the villages. But the guest is scared only as
long as he is under the roof. Next morning,
after an hour’s grace wherein to hide his tracks,
he may become the quarry of mine host.</p>

<p>Villages, the native <i>auli</i>, may be entered
by day, but it is safer to keep out of them.
They do not possess much which cannot be
found in the wayside inn. Provisions are very
scarce; such things as tea, sugar, bread, ham,
generally unobtainable. Eggs, and a species
of bread baked from millet seed, are the commonest
fare. The latter needs a good deal of
red wine to wash even a small quantity down.
It is called <i>churek</i>, and it is good for chickens.</p>

<p>In the summer and autumn wild fruits of
many kinds abound; strawberries, plums,
grapes, and a number of species not known
or sold in towns. The <i>kizil</i>, with its bloodlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
juice, is excellent boiled with plenty of sugar.
Wild grapes make good fruit but are inclined
to blister the lips. There is an endless abundance
of grapes upon the slopes of the Black
Sea shore. The wine is heady, and is apt to
put you to sleep in the noontide. It is better
enjoyed in the evening. It is marketed in
skins—but is none the less good for coming
out of a tight pig.</p>

<p>The only other parts of Russia to compare
with the Caucasus are the Crimea, the Urals,
and the Altai. The delightful Crimea is all
too limited in extent. It is very beautiful, and
possessed of marvelously good air. It is more
invigorating in the Crimea than in the Caucasus.
It is also easier and safer tramping.
It may take some time to recover from Bolshevism,
but I daresay it is more delightful in
desolation than it was in the days when it was
the national pleasure ground of the Russian
middle and upper classes.</p>

<p>The Urals are tame beside the Caucasus,
but they have a poetry of their own. The
many lakes and little hills and birch forests
make a welcoming land. One ought to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
something of geology and mineralogy when
tramping in the Urals. It is one of the most
remarkable parts of Europe from a geological
point of view. Every stone is interesting.
The man who can combine geology and tramping
is likely to have a very interesting experience,
and one that might even add to science
in its results. The Ural region, it should be
noted, is very extensive, and is for the most
part unprospected—especially northward.
The chief difficulty in tramping becomes ultimately
absence of people, and of food. The
gnats also swarm badly at night.</p>

<p>The Altai is also more or less untrodden
country; vast majestic mountain ranges separating
Siberia from China, forested and beautiful,
now rather difficult of access, even for a
starting point.</p>

<p>Of course, I went to Russia, not merely to
tramp for tramping’s sake, but in order to fill
in life, which is limited at home. I found
tramping to be the quickest way to a nation’s
heart. Many regions in which I have tramped
I could not recommend for the pleasure—thus,
Archangel to Moscow through the wet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
gloomy forests of the North, or Tashkent to
Vernoe, across the Central Asian desert. That
sort of expedition I would call student tramping,
and recommend it heartily as a means of
learning the truth about a country. No number
of museums or handbooks or columns of
statistics can give you the sum of reality obtained
quite simply and without particular effort,
upon the road. I have not tramped in
India or China or Japan, these problematical
countries. But, while there may not be much
pleasure in footing it there, I believe it to be
a way toward the understanding of their
peoples.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>

<p class="c sp lp">THE ART OF IDLENESS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE world is large enough, or is only too
small, as takes your fancy or speaks your
experience. But blue sky by day and fretted
vault of heaven by night give you the foil of
the infinite, making your petty exploit a brave
adventure. After surveying the map of the
world, thinking on this country and on that
with gusto of a Marco Polo, you may modestly
decide to take a little trip in Hertfordshire,
like Mr. Wyndham Lewis, who, on a certain
journalistic occasion, set forth to the discovery
of Rutland. Instead of going, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Kennan, into the wilds of Siberia for a year
or so, you may decide to go across the New
Forest during the Whitsuntide week-end, a
little <i>voyage au tour de ma chambre</i>. There
are thrills unspeakable in Rutland, more perhaps
than on the road to Khiva. Quality
makes good tramping, not quantity.</p>

<p>The virtue to be envied in tramping is that
of being able to live by the way. In that
indeed does the gentle art of tramping consist.
If you do not live by the way, there is nothing
gentle about it. It is then a stunt, a something
done to make a dull person ornamental.
I listen with pained reluctance to those who
claim to have walked forty or fifty miles a day.
But it is a pleasure to meet the man who has
learned the art of going slowly, the man who
disdained not to linger in the springy morning
hours, to listen, to watch, to exist. Life is like
a road; you hurry, and the end of it is grave.
There is no grand crescendo from hour to
hour, day to day, year to year; life’s quality
is in moments, not in distance run.</p>

<p>Fallen trees are to be sat on, laddered trees
to climb, flowers to be picked, nests to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
looked into, song birds to hear, falcons to be
watched. The river invites you to strip. You
sit under the cascade in the noontide; you climb
into caves to cool and dry. The green roof
of the mole’s track is to be followed till you
find the gentleman in velvet in his home. The
sound of the tapping of the woodpecker shall
guide you to the loose-barked tree where with
watchful eye a bird of beauty is hunting the
unmannerly wood louse. You shall approach
gently the deer who, in a group, wait for you
with startled eyes. They run from the crashing
and speedy—they can be won by the gentle.
Wild nature is not so wild as we think, or we
are wilder—it is not so far from us, and we
are nearer.</p>

<p>You can enter a wider family if you are
gentle. The rabbit which tempts your stones
will come and smell at your toes, the birds will
hop on you and sing as you lie in the grass,
even the alleged ferocious animals, such as
bears, will come and take bread from your
hands—if they feel you are near to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>means he liveth best. Pan is indeed more
truly our god than Diana. The chaste Diana,
the great huntress, is a romantic figure—but
not one of us. She would not have us with
her, we will not have her with us. We will
keep company with wood nymphs and satyrs,
and will help to turn the animals another way
when we hear Diana’s horn resounding in the
forest. She shall go on and find the world a
wilderness in front of her—the living and the
loving all slipping behind.</p>

<p>Nature unfolds herself slowly like a snail
if you are still in front of her. You cannot
know what you are walking over till you cease
walking. The lizard which has eyed you furtively
from under a stone comes forth and
squeaks to you—you make friends with him,
in fact. And as you sit on the hillside, or lie
prone under the trees of the forest, or sprawl
wet-legged on the shingly beach of a mountain
stream, the great door, that does not look like
a door, opens.</p>

<p>The noontide meal is a siesta which can be
very pleasantly prolonged. It only takes half
an hour to make the fire and boil the pot, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
you have left no “back in half an hour” notice
in any town; there should be no “got to be”
anywhere at any time, no hotel that you are
making for twenty miles the other side of the
range; no rendezvous with a young cousin or
an old man at the crossroads at sundown, but
a blessed insouciance regarding men and
things.</p>

<p>The grand desideratum is to have found an
agreeable spot. “We can put in forty minutes
here!”—“My friend, <i>hours</i>!”</p>

<p>The ants shall carry away the sausage rind
and the beetles devour the cucumber peeling;
bees shall sip where sweet coffee has fallen,
shy rodents shall clear earth’s table of crumbs—while
the heart wells up with joyful conversation,
or the eyes drowsily settle on their
lower lids. There is a joyous, light-green
glittering sleep between the hours of two and
four, hours not lost nor to be missed in the
temporal economy of the tramp.</p>

<p>There arrive light and happy dreams, the
soft-stepping <i>arrières pensées</i> of the tramping
life. The whole soul has relaxed, the mainspring
of citizenship has run down, and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
ring no alarms. It means a change in the condition
of passivity. You are at home to fairies
and fancies and to the spider of happiness who
spins golden webs. It is a fallacy to think
that during the siesta you do not tramp; you
are tramping, wandering in unknown parts,
exploring the primitive, opening doors, making
new connections with the great unity of which
you have been a nonconscious part.</p>

<p>You wake with no headache, but with, instead,
a freshness and eagerness. You do not
start at the unfamiliar scene; you know yourself
to be at home. You look upon your companion
still sleeping—did you ever look upon
your friend asleep—not in a bed in a hotel, or
on a red sofa after dinner, or in the dim corner
of a jolting train—but in Nature’s house?
There you will feel him nearer, more of a
friend, more kindred. The same wood sprites
have hopped on you both while you slumbered
and dreamed.</p>

<p>You continue the way with more <i>camaraderie</i>,
doing an indolent eight or nine miles
before sundown. The afternoon walk is likely
to be different from the morning one; you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
less eager, more passive and indulgent and
sociable. One is on the lookout for a fellow
tramp—for an exchange of thoughts. If you
are by yourself, you have at least the <i>alter ego</i>
of your thoughts, and if with another there is
his mind. One should not, however, always be
shy of a chance third—the man who comes out
of Nature to meet you.</p>

<p>Things happen <i>hors de programme</i> which we
could never put into our program. That is
why programs of coming life should be of
the most general character, none of that
“to-day I brew, to-morrow I bake” type of
miscalculation. “To-day I do not know what
I shall do; to-morrow I know less” is better.
“Someday or other the Queen’s daughter I
take” is sufficient—if not too much. Leave
plenty of room for God—the devil may use
some of the spare room, but no matter, he is
only a secondary character in our affairs.</p>

<p>The tramp carries no wrist watch. He has
no zero hour—no zero plus forty-three at which
he must take his section over the top. In his
cave he has no presentation timepiece mounted
on lions or mermaids. As he walks he does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
not raise his eyes to scan Big Ben through the
gloom—for his life is not parceled out in
Parliamentary quantities. He has no dashed
repeater in his pouch, no alarm clock at his
ear. The deathwatch does not sound in the
wall of his forest house; he does not live and
sleep beside that coffin on end called a grandfather,
“his life-seconds numbering tick-tock-tick.”
He listens for no morning hooter; he
boils his eggs without a measure of sliding
sand; he punches no time clock when he begins
his day’s tramp, and at the end the last trump
shall catch him unawares—an irrelevancy.</p>

<p>The most profound philosophers have been
engaged for any number of years trying to
explain time, and they are all agreed that it
is an illusion. The universe would go on existing
if all human beings were destroyed, but
what we call “time” would not. Time, they
are assured, must be relative. The little beetle
which we tread upon feels a pang as great as
when a giant dies. His normal life may be
five months only—but he has as extensive a
notion of his life as we have of what we call
the normal span—our fourscore years. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
insect which lives only an hour fits the fourscore
years of impressions into it somehow.
“If you can fill the unforgiving minute with
sixty seconds worth of distance run”—the insect
does it, better than you can.</p>

<p>The fact is, the minutes are not unforgiving.
We have to reverse many of the Grub Street
maxims: “Take care of the minutes, Freddy,
and the hours will take care of themselves.”
No, take care of the hours and the minutes can
go hang. Take care of your life and your
days will be all right.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield’s <i>Letters to his Son</i> and
Arnold Bennett’s <i>How to Live on Twenty-four
Hours a Day</i> are of little value to us.
We will not read in our baths, nor memorize
French verbs while we fry. Or we will, if we
like, but not upon the compulsion of filling
time.</p>

<p>You will discern that going tramping is at
first an act of rebellion; only afterwards do
you get free from rebelliousness as Nature
sweetens your mind. Town makes men contentious;
the country smooths out their souls.
The worship of time as a reality is such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
powerful superstition that the mind returns to
it often after it has got free. It returns again
and again, reciting its outworn creed: Thou
shalt have one birthday a year and one only;
six days shalt thou labor, but only the seventh
is the Lord thy God’s.</p>

<p>The tramp repeats it, and then unpacks his
heart with stinging words. The mood passes.
We, too, can be sweet and indulgent about
time and time-tables, bivouacking in eternity.
We may even carry a compass clock and, lying
in the grass, holding it in our hands, exclaim
facetiously with Touchstone: “It is ten
o’clock, in another hour it will be eleven”—and
moralize equally facetiously, for, “so from
year to year we ripe and ripe and then from
year to year we rot and rot—and thereby
hangs a tale.”</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER NINE</p>

<p class="c sp lp">EMBLEMS OF TRAMPING</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE fire is the altar of the open-air life.
Its wandering smokes go upward like
men’s thoughts; its sparks are like human lives.</p>

<p>The coffeepot is the emblem of conviviality.</p>

<p>The roughhewn staff, the tramp’s third leg,
is the emblem of his will to jog on.</p>

<p>The knapsack, like Pilgrim’s burden, is the
confession of mortality, and of the load which
every son of Adam carried on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Every door and gate which he sees means
the <i>way out</i>, not the way in.</p>

<p>There are three emblems of life: the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
is the open road, the second is the river, and
the third is the wilderness. The road is the
simplest of these emblems—with its milestones
for years, its direction posts to show you the
way, its inns for feasting, its churches for
prayer, its crossroads of destiny, its happy
corners of love and meeting, its sad ones of
bereavement and farewell; its backward vista
of memory, its forward one of hope.</p>

<p>Life certainly is like a road, or a network of
roads; like a highway for some, like a pleasant
country road for others, like a crooked lane for
some, like a path that bends back to its beginnings
for most.</p>

<p>There is the narrow way of the Puritans, a
passage between walls of righteousness; there
is the broad way of the epicureans, so broad
they mistake the breadth for the length and
lose themselves on it. But, broad or narrow,
the road seems inadequate as an emblem of
the tramping life. There shall be roads in our
life but our life shall not be always in roads.</p>

<p>The road smacks rather of duty and purpose,
of utility, and of “getting there.” Our
penchant is to get off the road. I do not care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to link tramping with utility. It may be good
for the physical health, but that shall not be
its object; it may be good for broadening the
mind and deepening the sources of pleasure,
but these are not the goal. Tramping is a
straying from the obvious. Even the crookedest
road is sometimes too straight. You learn
that it is artificial, that originally it was not
made for mere tramping. Roads were made
for armies and then for slaves and laborers,
and for “transport.” Few have been made for
pleasure.</p>

<p>But was life merely meant for pleasure?
Perhaps not. But it was meant for happiness
or for the quest of happiness.</p>

<p>You are more likely to meet your enemies,
if you have any, upon the road than off it.
But then also you are more likely to meet
friends there, too. You may seek your friends
with success on the road. And if you wish
counsel they are there to help you. “Life is
like a road,” says a Kirghiz proverb. “If you
go astray it is not your enemies who will show
you the way, but your friends.”</p>

<p>Still, where the Kirghiz live, in Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Asia, there are few roads and you cannot go
astray on them. The proverb must refer to
mountain tracks. “Life is like a mountain
track.” Yes, that is better. Let the mountain
track be our first emblem of life.</p>

<p>For the Sokols and the Scouts, the roads
shall mean much more, because their lives are
auxiliary to military efficiency. They learn to
be ready to resist an enemy of their homeland.
A good scout becomes a good volunteer soldier,
a good route marcher. But scout and sokol
are transitional. The Scout movement is like
a tug to take an ocean-going ship out of
harbor. There comes a point when the ship
can make its destiny under its own steam. The
Scout and Guide movement helps boys and
girls out of the rut of home and village, starts
them moving, and once set going, many of
them keep moving all their lives and never
once stagnate. On the roads that lead out
into the great world they march in their companies,
with scoutmasters and commanders.
Then the road is a glorious symbol of freedom
and life.</p>

<p>The second emblem is the river, which, clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
and innocent, finds the easiest and most charming
way from birth to eternity. We were born
on an invisible river which keeps gliding and
singing and filling and flowing. We do not
know where we go, but we know we are on the
stream. We do not always perceive the movement,
but we observe that the landscape has
changed.</p>

<p>So when we look on a river we are affected
by its hidden relationship to our own life. The
river interprets our mood. The road suggests
God as a taskmaster who would have us work;
the river suggests Him as a poet who would
have us live in poetry. The Creator must be
a poet—not a General or a Judge or a Master
Builder; there is so much of pure poetry in
His creation. The river, like a child’s definition
of a parable, is an earthly story with a
heavenly meaning.</p>

<p>When we look on a river with a poet’s eyes
we see in it the reflection of an invisible river,
the river of Time, the river of man’s life, the
river of Eternity. “Man may come and man
may go, but I go on for ever.”</p>

<p>There is a strange and wonderful vigilance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
about the river which rolls past us where we
sleep in the grass, murmuring and calling the
whole night long, something of the vigilance
of the starry sky. You sleep, but an eternal
sleepless sentry paces by all the while.</p>

<p>Then in the morning, when we bathe in the
river, we are our own John the Baptists, out
in the wilderness, baptizing ourselves with
water, and saying: “Repent, for the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand. Turn away from
the road for Heaven is near by.” And we
eat that wild honey of the wilderness, which
the prophet ate when his baptizing was done.</p>

<p>When we wash in the stream we are washing
ourselves with life. When we swim in the
stream, especially against the stream, we are
joying the heart of an unseen Mother who
takes pride in us all, knowing that, although
we must at last flow out with the
stream, we can triumph over it for moments.</p>

<p>And, drinking from the stream, we partake
of the water which flows from the mountain
of God—Nature’s communion cup.</p>

<p>The third emblem of life is the wilderness—that
place to which wise men and poets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
saints are driven in the last resort. “There is
a pleasure in the pathless woods,” wrote
Byron. “There is society where none intrudes.”
The wilderness tells you more, when
you are attune to it. That is seldom the experience
of the tramp on his first long divagation
from the beaten track. The wilderness
tires him, the forests blind him, the mountains
wear him down, the endless plain rises under
him and he smites his feet.</p>

<p>But there comes a point when there is a
symmetry even in the wildest disarray of
Nature, when man’s symmetry of parks and
garden cities and roads and rides is a poor
joke, a strange aberration of the human mind.</p>

<p>The universe is a most complicated lock
with innumerable wards and windings and
combination numbers. If the starry sky at
night is a lock—you would say there is no key
in the world to fit it. No key in the world
truly—but in the human heart somewhere there
is a wonderful key. “Have I not in my
bosom a key called ‘Promise?’” said Pilgrim.
When you find that key you can plunge it into
the cunning aperture of Nature or Night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
But you must know the combination numbers,
and even then it will not turn if you do not
first sing a verse of the Song of the Heart.</p>

<p>Quite a fairy tale. Even so. Life is a fairy
tale, one of a series, like the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.
And if it is a fairy tale rather than what Darwin
and Herbert Spencer and Einstein have
averred, how much more important to us all
the fairy tale becomes.</p>

<p>Fairy tales are begun in the midst of woods,
in strange forgotten glades, and at moments
between dawn and the morning, and sunset
and night.</p>

<p>“Fairy tales,” wrote Novalis, “are dreams
of our homeland—which is everywhere and
nowhere.” And to be everywhere and nowhere
at the same time means to be in the
wilds, and preferably quite lost. The absolute
tramp, whom, I may say, I have never met,
is a man with no address, no card, no reliable
passport, no recognizable finger prints. But
of course he is no ape man, no Tarzan, or son
of Tarzan. Choice, not accident, leads him to
the wilds.</p>

<p>The starry sky is the emblem of home, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
highest roof in the universe. The sun is the
mind, by whose light man seeks his way; the
moon is the reflection of the mind on the heart,
and is the emblem of melancholy and poetry.</p>

<p>However, of all these emblems, the coffeepot
is apt to be the most real and vital. You
will be on your knees morning and evening
before your altar fire, abasing your brow and
blowing the flames which are beneath it. Sun,
moon, forest, river, road—these pass, but the
coffeepot remains. It is so in life generally,
and the tramp, however much a poet he may
be, is a mortal like the rest of us. The moon
may be hidden by a cloud, but that is not
nearly so calamitous as having left the coffeepot
at the last camping place.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER TEN</p>

<p class="c sp lp">THE FIRE</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>O not forget the matches! Our dear
friends and the girl guides can imitate
the savages, and strike a light by rubbing two
sticks together, or they carry steel and flint
and tinder, and are always ready with a spark.
But that is beyond us. It is difficult to light
the two sticks. Remember the odd scraps of
dry paper—especially on a wet day. Even a
scoutmaster finds difficulty in making fire with
wet sticks.</p>

<p>Making a fire is a considerable diversion.</p>

<p>Unless you are very hungry it should take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
time. You find the suitable place, fix your
stones, gather the wood, fill the coffeepot,
make yourself at home, and only then strike
the match. It is a mistake to light the fire
before the coffeepot is ready.</p>

<p>You will ascertain the direction of the wind,
and put down your knapsack in a position
where sparks will not fly on to it. And you
will place your stones or tripod in such a position
that the wind will drive the flames on to
it. If your coffeepot is on the wrong side of
the wind it may take a long time to boil.</p>

<p>You must be careful to choose stones which
are high enough and ledgy enough to afford
a draught for the fire, and a secure lodgement
for the coffeepot.</p>

<p>To start the fire you need the thinnest and
tiniest of bits of wood—the little dead stems
which lurk in the grass. The long dry stalks
of withered wild flowers are even better than
wood, and if you have these you need no paper
to start the fire. They burn like dry stubble—which
is, in fact, what they are. Dead grass,
however, is of little good; it burns, burns out,
smokes, and gives little heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>The second line of fuel is the smart little
bits of crackling wood to be found nearly
everywhere. The third line is of stout bits of
wood. The fourth, if you feel like it, is the
really substantial timber you may haul to the
scene. To boil your pot you do not need this
last, but, remembering you will sit an hour or
so by the camp fire, you do well to have a
supply beside you.</p>

<p>The fire laid, lit, crackling, the pot warming
and heating, you may relax your attention,
spread out the victuals, take off your boots,
enjoy the beginning of the night’s rest. It is
wonderful coffee that comes out on these occasions.
You might not care for it indoors,
but you revel in it as the product of your own
camp fire.</p>

<p>You may have difficulty in lighting your
fire in the damp, but it can be got going even
in the wettest weather, granted, of course, that
there is suitable fuel. The secret is to possess
plenty of paper. You prepare a number of
balls of paper and put them in a dry place
until you have collected fuel. Your fuel will
be first of all withered stems of weeds and bits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
of perfectly dead wood. If there are trees
about look for dead branches in them. A dead
branch in a tree is always drier and more combustible
than a dead branch in the grass. The
wet on it will prove to be surface damp, easily
dried off. Be careful to avoid a very wet base
for your fire. A rocky ledge or heap of stones
is better. Having that, then even in drenching
rain you may start your fire, carefully sheltering
it with waterproof cape or blanket, while
with the burning paper balls you dry and inflame
the withered weeds and dead wood.
Very soon you will have a flaming fire which
has the heat in itself to dry its own fuel, even
if it be both substantial and very wet. Get a
big fire going, and you can defy the elements.
Should you be traveling in the vicinity of a
railway line you will often find many bits of
coal scattered from locomotives. These are
not to be disdained on a rainy day, as they
greatly add to the heat at the bottom of your
furnace. You fight the wet with heat rather
than with flame. It is a pleasant triumph on
a rainy day to watch your pot boil on a gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
fire, and to feel the clothes on your back a-drying
all the while.</p>

<p>The fire in the rain is a triumph; the night
fire in darkness under the stars is the happiest,
but it disputes happiness with the dawn fire.
Remember that on the black patch of your
evening fire you will rebuild the bonfire next
morning after your night <i>à la belle étoile</i>. It
is commonly more easy to light the fire in the
morning. There may be dew, but you have
a dry patch to build on. If you have had forethought
you have covered both the place and
some dry fuel to make easy your morning task.
You are less tired, less excited, in the morning,
and you know just where to look for the
auxiliary fuel, the stuff that makes the first
little fire burn up well.</p>

<p>I love to see the blue smokes crawling upward
in the dawn, while, with bare legs, one
struts about doing the domestic work of
morning out of doors. It is part of the very
poetry of the tramping life. You give a proper
affirmative then to Browning’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Only morning is apt to be at five, and then the
world is even more all right than at the
bourgeois hour of seven.</p>

<p>The good tramp does not spend too long,
however, by his morning fire. It is his best
time for being on the move. All Nature’s
loveliness awaits him as, with gossamer in his
hair, and light burden on heart and shoulder,
he fares forth for the day. He makes his coffee,
and then carefully puts out the fire, so as
to be sure not to start some conflagration on
the waste or in the forest. And he goes onward
toward midday, and that other fire which
is midday between the other two. Then he
seeks a shady place, a happy resting spot,
viewing the mountains, or beside a stream for
preference. And once more, God’s open-air
kitchen is smoking.</p>

<p class="c sp lp">THE BED</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent0"><i>Rise with the lark and with the lark to bed,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Observe some solemn sentimental owl;</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>But first, before we make ourselves a fool or fowl,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Let us enquire if the larks have any beds at all.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEY have, they have. The tramp is a
lark of a kind, and makes a little nest
each night. It is apt to be a pleasant place.
There are few “restless pillows” in the open-air
bed. England, of course, is not the country
for it. There is so much rain and dew that the
sleeper out of doors is like to develop fungoid.
But in America the ordinary population is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
<i>épris</i> of the fresh, uncovered night, that nearly
everyone outside the great cities sleeps at least
on the porch, or in a garden hammock slung
between trees.</p>

<p>I am prejudiced in favor of that kind of
tramping where one sleeps out. Strictly
speaking, if one sleeps in hotels or houses, it
is not a tramp but a walking tour. You cannot
afford to be divorced from Nature, and the
winds at sundown. The continuity of day and
night in the open is golden gain. The objections
against it in a dry healthful climate are
commonly trivial. For instance, danger.
Some think it dangerous. They believe they
may be attacked by robbers or by wild beasts.
But robbers do not search the woods and the
wilderness for likely victims. Unless, by your
behavior you should attract attention, there is
not the slightest risk of interference on the
part of man. I can imagine some rather rich
dandified intemperate pair going singing
along the road from some wayside pothouse
when they have incontinently advertised their
intention of sleeping out. The bad lad of the
village, or some local wag, has overheard, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
determines on a hold-up. The victims have
themselves to blame.</p>

<p>As evening comes on, the tramp should become
more shy. It is a mistake to choose one’s
evening camp in full view of the highway. For
one’s own subsequent peace of mind it is better
to have been unobserved. Though if you are
a stout fellow, why worry? I have had midnight
visitors before now, and have stirred up
the embers of the fire to make another pot of
coffee, but it has generally been pleasant and
interesting, a diversion.</p>

<p>As regards wild beasts, that is a danger
greatly overestimated. If you are thoroughly
wild, the wild beasts will know it and respect
you. They much prefer to bite the white, the
soft, the civilized and the timid. The puma is
an unsociable lady but she may generally be
reckoned upon to leave you alone, even if she
does resent your sleeping on her grounds.
The bear, with his inquisitive snout, may come
snuffing for your provisions, but he will not
attack you unless you are going to attack him.
It should be understood that wild animals have
an uncanny power of sensing your state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
mind and your intentions. They know if you
are scared, and they know if you are going
to jump up and strike at them. They know
also if you have no fear, and if you are friendly.
If you are calm and easy-going you can
often make up to a bear and feed him. I
imagine that was the secret of those early
Christians who were famous for their friendship
with the fiercest of animals.</p>

<p>More dangerous, however, are reptiles, and
one should avoid lying down in a basket of
snakes. In a snake-swarming country it is as
well to avoid caves, especially those with many
ledges. Dry ditches also, though sometimes
attractive hollows for the spreading out of bedding,
are often the home of snakes. You have
observed them there by day. They remain at
night. As regards the open, it is easy to beat
out the brush so as to make sure that no rattler
is going to be disturbed later on. Sleeping
against walls has also its dangers, not only
from snakes but from scorpions. The scorpion
is a loathsome creature; even seeing one is
rather a shock, and the bite is reputed to be
specially poisonous. In tarantula country a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
sleeping bag or a hammock is preferable to a
bed spread on the ground. But when all hazards
have been considered, a bed out of doors
is safer than a bed in a house. The roof will
not fall in; there is no danger of fire.</p>

<p>Experience, however, tells when it comes to
choosing a resting place and making it comfortable.
It is not a happy thing to plump
down at the end of the day at random upon
feeling tired. You cannot sleep pleasantly
on a heap of stones, or in a marsh, or on a
canting surface. You need to think of the
chances of rain, or of mosquitoes, or creeping
damp.</p>

<p>The commonest mistake is that of leaving
the choice of a resting place till too late. It
is sometimes fantastically difficult to make
oneself comfortable if one starts about it after
nightfall, or in the late twilight. You need
time. Any time after five o’clock in the afternoon,
should you come upon an ideal spot for
spending the night, it is better to give up
tramping for the day there and then and take
over your billet.</p>

<p>If it is raining you need the shelter of heavily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
foliaged trees, or of a cave, or of an overhanging
rock, or of a bridge over a river, or
of a barn. If it is at all likely to rain you
need to have such refuges near you, so that
you can decamp readily and easily, and without
mislaying half your kit. Of all these, the
overhanging rock is the most pleasant, and
like it, the large slanting tree trunk, or some
protruding bank of earth and turf.</p>

<p>Rain is not such a calamity in the tramp’s
night as might appear, though a long spell of
rainy weather may be depressing. Even if
one gets a little wet at night it is not too unpleasant.
I have known pleasure in a soaking
night out of doors. One reckons, however,
upon sunshine next morning and the chance of
drying off before ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Much discomfort is caused by stones at
night.</p>

<p>“Stones Thy pillow, earth Thy bed,” says
the Lenten hymn, but earth thy pillow, stones
thy bed, is more in the natural order. The
tired body finds the stones but the hand does
not. It is well to make a good clearance of
stones from the natural hollow you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
chosen. A goodly stone may help at the head,
but the best pillow is generally one’s pack, or
one’s boots with a softer covering.</p>

<p>If possible, it is better not to settle down to
sleep on sloping ground—for you slide all
night and may slide into a much worse position
than that originally chosen. In the mountains,
where there is little level ground, it is better
to seek a hole or a hollow or a natural shelf
or recess. If you have to sleep on the edge of
a precipice, it is as well to choose a place which
has the chance barricade of a tree or a bush
or a rock. Tramps are much afraid of rolling;
but if proper precautions are taken one
can sleep even where the eagle builds.</p>

<p>In the valleys, it is well to avoid sleeping
too low. Inviting dells are often covered with
but a thin carpet of sun-dried earth under
which is bog. Marsh damp creeps upward in
the early hours of the morning, and you wake
in an unpleasant fog. Insects and reptiles
abound in such places, and a bad night with
them may spoil a good day.</p>

<p>There are so many ideal spots for sleeping
the night, and they are so diverse that it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
be folly to catalogue or to enumerate. You
see them as you go along. You get into the
habit of spotting them. Even in the morning
you remark as you go along: “Ah, a good
place for spending a night!” It is a little like
choosing villas in a locality generally agreeable.
One has this point, the other has this
special convenience.</p>

<p>The view counts for a good deal. Night is
a visit to the opera. You want to see all the
stars; you want a good stall. The views of the
landscape, of the trees, of the sky—these are
charms of residence.</p>

<p>You suit yourself regarding shelter from
the wind or exposure to the wind, southern
aspect, and all that. Some like to lie in the
wind, others in the calm. As regards aspect,
it is not where the sun shines at noon that interests
you, but from what gap it dawns.
Moon aspect also is not an inconsiderable
matter.</p>

<p>As regards mere comfort, much may be
done if there is time. You can make yourself
a mattress of wild flowers, and wallow like a
tramp in clover. You can pile up dried weeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
under you. You can improve on your pillow,
smooth down your lonely pillow, in fact. You
can ingeniously use various contents of your
knapsack to give more warmth or softness.
Those who feel the cold can put in hot rocks.</p>

<p>The hot rock is a cowboy device. You take
some fair-sized stones, heat them in your camp
fire, then wrap them up in whatever comes
handy and place at the foot of the bed—this
gives a sort of hot-water bottle. When tramping
in high mountains you almost inevitably
approach the snow line at times, and it is cold
even in July. The hot rocks come in useful.
Personally, I do not feel cold much, but I have
tried hot rocks and have been surprised to
realize that they retain their warmth even till
morning. Their chief drawback is the scorch
they may give you if by chance you undo the
wrapping and put your leg on a naked stone.
Some walkers get so enamored of hot rocks
that they will sleep hugging a big one to their
bosom.</p>

<p>Of course, one soon discovers that a night in
the shelter of a great rock is warmer than a
night in the unprotected open, and a night in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
a cave warmer even than that. Caves facing
westward over the sea keep the sun low in them
all night; caves on the western sides of mountains
do the same. But this does not apply to
profound caves which may be very cool. A
night in a cave is an adventure, but it is likely
to be less pleasant than a night outside. The
floor of a cave is uncommonly hard, and a
ridge in the floor may wear you out if you try
to sleep across it. The pleasant part of a
cave for sleeping is the mouth of it. It is just
as well, by the way, to make sure that the cave
is uninhabited before establishing yourself for
the night.</p>

<p>In more civilized parts I have spent very
pleasant nights under bridges. I cannot recommend
railway bridges, as the trains shake
down dirt, but river and road bridges have
frequently very sweet natural homes for wanderers,
close in where the first timbers meet
the ground. One should, however, arrive in
time to choose a place which has not been used
before you by some domestic animal, since you
may find insects in such places.</p>

<p>In certain countries the hammock is an ideal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
convenience for sleeping, but it needs getting
used to, and there are some people who always
fall out of them in the night. In the jungles
of the tropics or of subtropical countries, it is
the accepted mode. You need enough mosquito
netting to swathe your body three times
and, wrapped in that, you swing in your boat
of rope.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>

<p class="c sp lp">THE DIP</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME tramps have a groundless fear of
water. In Russia they call it <i>vodaboyazn</i>,
which means simply “water fright,”
and is a better word than hydrophobia, which
means the same thing, but is connected in the
mind with mad dogs. Here, no mad dog is in
question. Water: a liquid recommended for
external use, is greatly despised by certain
winebibbers who affect to be afraid that it will
get into the wine. The fact is, most of them
have got the water fright. After a stout bottle
of Burgundy and a cigar, what more dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
torture can be imagined than sitting under a
fountain of water. It is better to sit in an old
leather chair in a Piccadilly window than on a
chair in the rocks under a flowing cascade. “I
am for that Piccadilly window,” says the confirmed
lizard—and not a few tramps are at
one with the clubman. However, once you
get the water fright it is almost incurable, and
perhaps not worth writing about.</p>

<p>Coldness of the water is a prejudice. The
coldest dip in the sea is easier to take than the
ordinary cold bath in a cramped bathroom.
The immediate activity of the body conquers
the cold. In a bathroom most people have to
be painfully passive. But truly, in those seasons
of the year when one is able to sleep out
of doors one need not fear the temperature of
the water.</p>

<p>The morning swim is such an embellishment
of the open-air life that many are tempted to
plan their whole expedition with that in view.
Thus they would rather tramp along the sea-shore
or in a region of many lakes than traverse
a region of little rivers and springs, but
no water of depth. The dip means a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
deal extra in happiness, health and vigor. I
think I prefer the lake to the sea—that is,
after a night out of doors. It is colder and
fresher. Its unruffled gray and silver seems
to have been spread specially for you to plunge
into.</p>

<p>It is a different matter to come from an
hotel bed out to the margin of the mere and
wade into early morning loveliness. That is
good, but it is not the best. You miss the continuity
of experience. A night with the moon
and wild flowers, with fleeting clouds and
seeming-fleeting stars, with cool and warm
airs wandering, with wood whispers and the
nightingale’s song, has its fitting <i>envoi</i> in
twenty minutes’ plashing after dawn. Nature
learns that the tramp is awake.</p>

<p>You scoop a coffeepot full of water from
the same pool wherein you bathe. You see the
coffeepot standing on the bank like a faithful
bird awaiting your return from the water.
Mother-naked, you plunge and strive and indulge
in various forms of joyous excess. The
gray dawn sky above is gentle as loving eyes.
The blue smoke of your fire has lost itself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
plays with the morning air as you do with the
water.</p>

<p>After that, still dripping, you carry the
coffeepot to the fire. You dry as you walk.
It may be your pleasure as a man to return
to the lakeside and shave. You stand in the
freshness with no one near and brandish a
lathered shaving brush; you may not get all
the hair off, but what more delicious shave
than this!</p>

<p>The next item in the program may be the
morning wash. You can wash out a shirt,
a pair of socks, a towel, the sugar bag, what
you will, and dry them as the morning sun
warms up. This is a necessary matter now
and then. It is not convenient to save up bits
of washing for some village lass to do, or for
some town laundry; it means delay in uncongenial
places.</p>

<p>The dip is also associated in the mind with
fishing. Dawn is the hour when they jump,
and the angler-tramp loves the dawn shadows
of the morning twilight. He catches his
breakfast before he bathes, guts his fish, gets
ready his frying pan—for you do not want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
wait too long for food once you have been in
the water.</p>

<p>But it is not only at dawn that one bathes.
Any good stream or pool at any time is a good
pretext for a dip. There is some danger of
overdoing it at the beginning, especially when
it is sea bathing. The afternoon bathe is sometimes
tiring, if one has bathed also before noon.
A good plan is to bathe morning, noon and
night, but not too long at any time. If you
are a thoroughgoing lazy tramp you can sun
bathe for an hour or so also, but of course you
will not get far along the coast in the course of
a day. In lake and sea there is the temptation
of swimming, but most commonly, in mountain
tramping, swimming is not possible. The
rivers are too tumultuous, the lakes are boggy
or shallow. But there is considerable pleasure.
No happier noontide can be imagined than on
the stairs of a cascade where a little river,
plunging from a pass, makes its rocky and
foaming descent to gentler levels. You sit
well inside a water-worn slippery armchair,
while living crystal comes down on your head
and neck, on shoulders and back. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Rockies and in the Alps, in the Caucasus, and
in the Carpathians—wherever there are mountains,
there are such places and such delights.</p>

<p>When you reach the snow line there is pleasure
enough in snow bathing, though one
should beware of it when the body has got very
hot with arduous climbing. The snow often
has a comparatively solid crust, but when this
is broken it is soft underneath. It depends on
your constitution whether you can stand it at
a high altitude, but otherwise it is pleasant
sometimes in mid-July to plaster oneself with
the so-unfamiliar snow.</p>

<p>The evening swim, too, is a pleasure, taking
the tiredness out of your limbs and adding to
the happiness of your relaxation when, later,
you lie with your blanket over you under the
stars. It has not the joy of the dawn swim,
not the <i>joie de vivre</i> of that of noontide. But
it has the peace of an evening hymn or child’s
prayer. If you are a Celt or a Slav, it has
melancholy, the poetry of sadness. It tunes
the soul to the night mood and the awakening
of the dim stars and the coming on of that
intense silence, that stopped breath of Nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
which one senses in the first hours of the night.</p>

<p>From baptism comes grace. The spirit of
the water has found place in the bosom of the
wanderer. He may be a pagan at heart, but
he has come nearer to being a Christian if he
has thus bathed three times a day.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>

<p class="c sp lp">DRYING AFTER RAIN</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ET weather is not the tramp’s worst
enemy, but it leaves him with the problem
of drying his clothes. It may not damp
his spirits, but will probably damp his attire.
The walk in the rain, or worse than that, the
walk through rain-laden thickets after the rain
has ceased, the night slept in the rain when it
begins to drizzle at eleven and you think
naught of it, and to rain steadily at twelve
and there is no refuge, and to pour gently at
one and in torrents at two, and it is all the
same because you are already as wet as can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
be—these are modifications of Nature’s blessings,
pleasant or unpleasant in themselves according
to taste and breeding, but having, as
a natural sequence, the common duty of drying.</p>

<p>The wet dawn peers through the trees; pale
morning looks faintly upon a washed-out
camp, and two Rip Van Winkles, feeling a
hundred years older, lift up heavy and rusty
limbs, and reflect that it has been a wet night.
The problem is to get dry.</p>

<p>The first means is a fire. Grant the matches
have kept dry; or if they have not been kept
in a canister, that one of the tramps happens
to have a <i>briquet</i>! With a petrol lighter one
is independent of wet matches. Then the fire
must be carefully begun, nursed and nourished.
Perhaps one can find an old ruined
and red-rusty bucket on the waste—a gift of
Providence. The fire may be well started in
that. If you feel cold you may bring fuel to
the fire spot on the run—dead fuel of branch
and withered weed, heaps of it. One needs
to get a good fire going, a big fire, a drier.
“It can be done,” as a millionaire self-made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
man used to say. “Can’t must be
overcome.”</p>

<p>You know at sight when your fire has got
the upper hand of the surrounding damp.
That is your moment for executing a war
dance around it. The longer you dance the
quicker you dry. But do not forget reserves
of fuel. You need a fire on which you could
roast a sheep. For you have to dry, not only
your clothes, but the blanket, the knapsack,
and your spare linen. You find a corner for
your pot. It will boil and provide coffee while
you are engaged with drying.</p>

<p>Somehow or other the blanket has to be
hoisted up on to a line. You need string,
which I hope you have brought. If there is
a tree or a telegraph post or any other post,
or preferably two convenient trees, two convenient
posts, you can tie up the blanket and
let it dry in the heat of the fire. If these are
absent there may be a corner of a wired enclosure.
You must shift your fire to the
place where you can rig up the blanket. It
is seldom that absence of uprights of any
kind reduces you to holding the blanket in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
your own hands in front of the fire and drying
it so.</p>

<p>Indeed, if no convenience offers, you may
simply dry off your clothes and then tramp
on till you find a spot better equipped for
blanket drying. You will not, as a rule, have
to tramp far.</p>

<p>Clothes, however, do not dry as quickly as
expected. Especially the tweed jacket and its
shoulders take an unconscionable time a-drying.
It is not good for one’s health to tramp
with a heavy knapsack on wet shoulders. The
weight drives the damp inward, and as the
back warms and perspires it takes potential
rheumatism from the steam of the jacket. A
night out in the rain will not give you rheumatism;
many nights in the wet will not give
you rheumatism. It is not getting wet which
gives you these pains, it is the way you dry.
You are, in fact, safer scampering naked in
the wet than drying slowly in a heap of wet
clothes. Perhaps it is not amiss to remark
here that a waterproof worn over wet clothes
is a sure way to cultivate rheumatism. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
damp cannot escape outwards—and so goes
inward to your very bones.</p>

<p>Your shirt will dry quickest and easiest.
Wearing that, you can dry the rest of your
clothes at the fire, the lightest first. If your
boots are soaked it is better not to try and dry
them by a fire. Leather liketh not fire. There
is little harm in wearing wet boots and trusting
them to dry themselves as best they can.</p>

<p>It is a happy occasion, this of drying off.
One’s spirits are naturally exalted by it. It
is victory of a kind. The tramp sings as he
circles the fire. There is a music which belongs
to the mood, and it is a pity no great musician
has composed “While waiting for my clothes
to dry by an early morning fire.” The musicians
have not tramped enough.</p>

<p>However, in this light-hearted frolic, let us
not allow our linen to be ruined. Beware of
the long flames which try to lick your trousers
as they hang there in the wind; beware of the
scorching heat which browns and ruins a shirt;
beware of the showers of sparks which rise
when you throw a new log on the fire. For
some good reason, sparks are more plentiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
after rain than in the dry. Your fire may be
sending up sparks all the while, big, substantial
living sparks, which, settling on your drying
blanket, may fret it with holes. I have
had a blanket made holey by this before now.
The spark settles on the wool, ignites it gently,
and starts a hole which may be as big as a
cigar end before you notice it. As the blanket
gets nearer being perfectly dry you need to
retire it from the intimate ardors of the fire.
Your fire, in any case, has been getting hotter
and hotter. You have not noticed that it is
beginning to scorch your clothes and your
wraps.</p>

<p>That is the way of drying off. It suits all
weathers. But if, while you are engaged upon
it, the sun breaks forth, promising natural
heat, you may relax your energies from the
fireside and place your hopes on the morning
warmth. Nothing is more delightful than the
sun bath after rain. You enjoy it, your clothes
enjoy it, blanket enjoys it, knapsack enjoys
it, coffee enjoys it. As you are all spread
out on the hillside the butterflies settle on your
bare chest trying to take honey from you, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
flit thence to the knapsack which, perchance
moistened with sugar, gives an even pleasanter
reaction to the proboscis of a Vanessa.</p>

<p>A third dry-off is in a farmhouse at the
kindly hands of a farm wife, who hangs your
blanket and jacket in her kitchen, while her
husband regales you in the parlor with homebrew
and a hunk of fruit pie.</p>

<p>There are other less satisfactory ways of
drying; using newspapers as blotting paper
and stuffing the legs of your trousers with
them. But first find your dry newspapers.
Another method is to get up into a tree and
sit there till you are dry. The last I have
tried, but shivered so steadily that I gave it
up, resumed my way, and walked myself dry.
It is part of a genuine tramping outing to
get once thoroughly wet—and dry off.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>

<p class="c sp lp">MARCHING SONGS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>AN is a singing animal, but civilization
has silenced many songs. In so many
places I see exposed the lugubrious mourning
card—SILENCE! Silence in court, silence
in the office! How annoyed we can get to feel
when some one begins singing in a carriage of
a train. We crave silence and our newspapers,
silence and our pipes. We will not sing or
listen to singing on the way to our work. Indeed,
singing is not fitting; we might rather
sing coming home but not going out. But
coming home, we are all in too much of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
hurry, and the crowds irritate us, and we have
not had our supper. To tell the truth, we had
but a slight lunch and no wine. We never got
into the singing mood.</p>

<p>Our mentors are against singing. “Sing in
the morning, you’ll sob before evening,” says
one. “Sing on a Friday, you’ll weep on the
Sunday,” says the Catholic. Children sing
naturally and exuberantly on any and all occasions,
but father and mother and elder
brother and uncle and friend cannot bear it.
Send them to the garden, send them to the
nursery! We so dislike random singing that
we pay street musicians—to go away, and they
have learned that bad singing brings more
coppers than their better efforts. They are
professional irritants.</p>

<p>Yet singing is very natural, and when one
takes to the road the singing impulse comes
to the bosom. Light-heartedness begets song.
We sing as we walk, we walk as we sing, and
the kilometers fall behind. After a long spell
of the forced habit of not singing one finds
oneself accidentally singing, and there is surprise.
Good Heavens! I’m singing. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
singing what? Not the latest song, by any
means, but something remembered from childhood
and school days, the happy innocent
strains of days gone by. Songs give birth to
songs, memories to memories. The ear and
the heart explore the lost repertoire of music.
You sing all the old songs you ever knew, and
snatches of this, snatches of that, still-remembered
fragments of melody, tunes heard God
knows where. The voice glides from one thing
to another in a rhapsody of open-air happiness.
It is singing of freedom, of escape, of
absence of care and anxiety, of beauty. “Sing
me a song of a lad that is gone”—it is singing
that song over and over again on never-tiring
ears. “Say, could that lad be I?”—it is asking
the question, and your light heart is answering,
“Yes, yes, that lad was I. The tiresome
somber fellow who worked in a town was not
I. I was imprisoned in him. Now I am free
and I sing.”</p>

<p>At first it does not matter what you sing.
You sing some old love song of the heart, some
hymn by which your mother once sang you to
sleep, some boy’s song, sung on the way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
school or some “Promise of Life,” some
learned song, once lisped over the shoulder of
a young girl at the piano, some haunting ballad
or lyric out of the Celtic twilight, or some
lilting country air of an English countryside.
Absurdly you stamp it out as you walk:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Oh, let the night be ever so dark</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>And never so wet and wine-dy,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>I must have a will and turn back again</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>To the girl I left behind me.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And while you are going forward you are
really going back, and there is a girl waiting
for you ahead on your track—the playmate
girl of Nature whom you did once leave behind.
You sing as you go to her. You drift
from old English songs to Negro minstrelsy,
and still—it is some one waiting for you,
praying for you. She is waiting for you
“there by the door, in oh-old Singapore.”
Somewhere there is a “corn-fed bride”—where
the black-eyed Susans grow. You shift to
operetta and to the reveries of opera, especially
in the evenings, to serenades, to boat
songs and songs about stars and fair women’s
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Sing in the morning and you will sing all
day,” say I. “Sing on a Friday and you will
sing better on Sunday.” You shall sing by
the camp fire in the morning, and sing as you
dip in the stream, sing as you climb the rugged
mountain road, sing yourself to noontide and
the pass, like a lark rising upward in sheer
joy of living. You shall sing of home as you
descend in the afternoon, and sing in the dark
under the night sky by your fading fire. What
is a tramping day if it does not liberate a voice,
so that you can sing out your soul to the free
sky.</p>

<p>A slightly different temperament achieves
the same happiness reciting poetry, repeating
every verse ever conned for love of thought
or sound. This is singing of a kind. Songs
heard are sweet, but the unheard may be
sweeter. The heart can be lifted up by poetry
even more than by song. And the inner meaning
and sense of a poem becomes one’s own on
the march when it lends it rhythms and verbal
emotions to express the hidden yearnings of
one’s own being.</p>

<p>And the two can be combined—poetry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
song. There are those who sing all poetry
and call recitation singing. They incant and
intone as they tramp. They are lifted up in
an ecstasy which makes them independent of
physical tiredness or difficulties or meannesses
or past misfortunes or ill-treatment. Song
and poetry enfranchise you in the universe.
The tramp for moments becomes citizen of
the universe and knows all secrets, all mysteries,
all depths, all heights. He comes back
to earth anon, but he has seen and understood.</p>

<p>Such happiness is explored in one’s personal
repertoire of poetry and song that the tramp
who makes tramping a great part of his life
does well to add to what he has, taking pains
to note down the words of haunting airs and
verses. In Italy, in France, Spain, Germany,
and Slav countries, one inevitably hears melodies
one would like to remember. There is
folk music, and it can only be learned in the
countries where it is natural. There is something
in the singing of it which escapes all
notation. The ear, the mood of the soul, can
alone enable you to imitate it, to repeat <i>just</i>
what you have heard, what moved you. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
those who know little of music can capture
these songs if they will take the trouble to copy
the words and make the native singers repeat
and repeat till the songs come back again truly
from your lips.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE might call it by a better name; it
means getting a meal for nothing when
you can. In certain unspoiled parts of the
world there are outlandish folk who will take
the wanderer in, give him meat and drink, and
send him on his way rejoicing. You can still
get a swig of milk and a heaped pile of bannocks
in the North. They will fill you with
apples in Hereford and cream in Devon. A
good deal depends on your appearance. It is
not always fair, when you have been turned

have omitted the daily shave; your hat may
have a hole in it. Some one may have been

just before you came.</p>

<p>One should not trade upon hospitality. But
it is pleasant now and then to knock up a
farmer for a dinner, or rather, a farmer’s wife,

The hobo shamelessly works whole neighborhoods,

will bang every door in a village till he gets
what he calls a “hand-out.”</p>

<p>The supposed tramp hieroglyphics are of
little value—“Good feed here,” “’Ware dog;
want you to work for it,” etc. You have to
make good where these sharks have failed, and
it can be done occasionally by sheer good
humor and high spirits. A hot meal is worth
having occasionally, even if one has to make
friends with baby, or rescue the cat or blarney
the farm wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>A good method of approach is by offering
to buy something. One has always to be buying
milk for one’s coffee. The purchase may
lead to a friendly interest and the interest to
a seat at the table with the family, or at least
in the kitchen. Generally, speaking, it is better
for the family to have you in their midst.
You come from far, you have stories to tell,
you have the record of wild life. The children’s
eyes open as you discourse. The good
man drops his fork—but you do not drop
yours.</p>

<p>Thus the tramp may sometimes, for a
change, spend a pleasant noontide or evening
at a farm, fill up with a change of food, get
some good drink, and then round it off with a
pleasant sleep in a barn.</p>

<p>For this the shoddy make-up of the professional
hobo is out of place. It is of no use
imitating his “hard luck” stories, no use to
talk hypocritically of seeking work which it is
difficult to get. One should avoid the skulking
look which begets suspicion, and the sneaking
round the kitchen door. A brave and debonair
gait pays best. You enter as a gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
and cannot afford to be treated as a potential
thief or bandit. So much harm has,
alas, been done by cynical and callous tramps
who have abused hospitality where they have
found it, cursing, nevertheless, where it has
been denied. One should endeavor to give
something in return—not money—where hospitality
has been found, and so help to restore
a good thing in the world.</p>

<p>By one’s manners, by one’s talk, by a little
memento or token here and there, one pays for
hospitality received. In return for hospitality
of the body—food or lodging, one should
always give hospitality of the mind or spirit,
sympathy, fellow feeling, bonhomie, a readiness
to be at the disposal of your host.</p>

<p>There are, however, accidental modes of
scrounging which have no palliatives. Who,
can resist robbing an orchard of a few apples?
Oh, those Ohio apples! I’ve eaten many a
one at dawn without paying for it, big as your
fist, streaked with cheek-red, sweet as a kiss.
I have lifted the strawberries, too, from the
strawberry beds—the birds were not always to
blame—and I have picked the watched pear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
which was growing daily with nectarine. One
does not burn everlastingly for this in the hereafter.
All I can say is, that if I settle on the
land in my old age, some tramps may then
rob me for my sins.</p>

<p>Another useful gain to the tramp’s kitchen
is fish. Unless, however, he is a fisherman he
may find fish difficult to obtain. But upon
occasion, tramping beside lakes and rivers, one
may fall in with fishermen who, as a rule, will
gladly part with a portion of the catch, a proletarian
for cash, a gentleman for naught.
“Do you eat all you catch?” I once asked of
a tweed-clad angler. “Good heavens, no!” he
replied. “I throw most of what I catch back
in the stream.”—“Well, throw a couple in this
frying pan!” One should beware, however,
of making seemingly facetious remarks to the
melancholy angler, who has fished all night
and caught nothing. Like the apostles, he
needs a miracle to cheer him up.</p>

<p>When the Indian corn is ripe there is again
delightful food for stealing, and no one will
call you thief. Just go into one of those wonderful
bearded fields and select your cobs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
Take them to the camp fire and bake them or
boil them. It’s a great addition to dinner or
supper. Have you saved a little butter to
melt on the hot cob? What luxury! This is
not a tramp’s life. There are American millionaires
who, could they be clairvoyant in
their expensive hotels, would weep with envy.</p>

<p>The beloved Master of all Christian folk
showed us the way when, walking with his
pupils, he plucked the corn. He would have
loved corn on the cob, but Palestine is a sterile
place.</p>

<p>You have lifted the corn, you may go further,
less legitimately, and scrounge a small
marrow, and again a melon. In certain countries
that means no loss to any one. But let
us be diffident of taking the only melon, the
only marrow.</p>

<p>The best fun is, however, amid the wild
fruit, the berries, the grapes, the plums. One
lives on the kindly fruits of the earth. You
come on a hillside rusty-brown with little
strawberries, and only the birds to share them
with you. One spends hours grazing on strawberries.
Wild grapes, too, one eats with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
mouth from the vine without picking them.
Scrounging by and large is not the noblest
thing in a tramp’s life, but it means much to
him; there is happiness in it.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>

<p class="c sp lp">SEEKING SHELTER</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OMETIMES, at high altitudes in the
Alps, the Rockies, and elsewhere, one
comes upon bleak empty shelters built for protection
against wind and snow. Ordinary
tramping is not mountaineering, but, nevertheless,
it leads one upon occasion to wild and
desolate exalted regions. There seems to be
no particular danger except that of failing to
obtain provisions after supplies have run out.
But there is a danger, often unforeseen; the
coming on of a great storm.</p>

<p>A raging blizzard of snow is sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
blinding and perishing. All is veiled in driving
whiteness. The wind is piercing. After
a few steps the track, if there is one, is lost;
landmarks have disappeared from view, and it
is safer to stop than to go on. Not a few
people have met their deaths in an unexpected
snowstorm in the upper Alps. They may be
in fairly safe mountain country, but it is easy
to misjudge distance in such circumstances,
and go over a cliffside by a random step in the
snow. Unless you can find some sort of shelter
you are changed to a snow man in a few
minutes, and get disgustingly numbed. Even
if you lie down flat in the snow the storm
pierces to your bones.</p>

<p>Fortunately, one can generally see a storm
coming, and find a rock or a cave or some sort
of kraal or shepherd’s house. The cave is a
good place in which to await the storm and
then watch it pass.</p>

<p>Thunderstorms may be almost as perilous
as blizzards, and certainly more frightening.
You are up where the clouds meet; the electric
currents surge through you. Something dark
comes driving up the wedge between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
ranges, roaring below through the ravine. It
is the oncoming wind and rain. Thunders prodigious
and bellowing, break out upon the
right and left. You suddenly find yourself
in an island of pale subdued light, with clouds
rolling up to you from below. It is an experience
worth having if you possess the nerve
to take it calmly.</p>

<p>The lightnings are sometimes amazingly intimate,
wrapping you, wreathing you, bathing
you with fire, almost searing your eyeballs.
Criss-cross, flash, blare, effusion, confusion.
The explosions are dumbfounding and the
many echoes confound in one great infernal
battle music. There is an oncoming enemy
who always threatens, and never seems quite
to arrive. Or you are in the midst of the
mêlée with torrents battling across and across
you. You get soaked, the knapsack gets
soaked, the boots get soaked, the rock
under you becomes a water channel; the cliffs
on all sides discharge water against you, to
say nothing of what is raging out of the
sky.</p>

<p>Once more, it is better to watch it from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
cave. There is the enormous advantage of
keeping relatively dry. In a great storm a
certain amount of rain is bound to blow into
any cave, but there is the advantage of feeling
safer, whether one is or not. The lightnings
do not play quite so much about your eyes.
You are also out of the way of those rain-loosened
boulders which have a way of detaching
themselves in a storm, and coming violently
from above, falling sometimes at your
feet or dashing past your knees to fall another
two thousand feet into the abyss below you.
In the cave a falling rock is merely a feature
of interest, while you watch the grand spectacle
of a thunderstorm in the mountains. If
the storm last too long, one can generally
glean a coffeepot full of water, light a fire at
the mouth of the cave, and make some coffee
or tea.</p>

<p>In like manner one can take shelter from
mountain gales which sometimes spring up
with hurricane force and make perilous the
passage of some knife-edge track. It is not
wise to brave the elements when one false step
risks your life. Such gales commonly die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
down before sunset, and the succeeding calm
can be waited for with patience.</p>

<p>These are heroic occasions, but there are
others less heroic which bid us seek shelter.
One may be down below in the quiet country,
and yet as devastating a thunderstorm intervene,
or heavy drenching rain, or a bone-searching
northeaster. But down below it is
easier to find refuge. There are keepers’ huts
in forests, holes dug by animals, hollow trees,
there are deserted houses, barns, outhouses,
bridges. There are human homes, inns, hotels—even
railway stations and covered vans. Obtaining
shelter, except on wide and desolate
moors, is not so difficult. On moorland there
is nothing for it but to put on one’s waterproof
cape, over knapsack and all, and brave it out.
You will find of what enormous value the
waterproof cape can be, not only being your
ground sheet at night, but saving you your
provisions and kit, from a deluge of rain.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a storm beginning
in the afternoon will last all night. One
must judge by the look of the sky. On a shelterless
moor or plateau it is no gain to shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
one’s eyes to the dire possibilities of the situation.
It is an occasion when the art of idleness
can be put aside. If it is necessary to walk
a steady twenty miles to some place of shelter
for the night, it is as well to set the mind to
it. After the first mile in the rain the tramp
becomes pleasant; after five or ten miles one
begins to sing. One generally finishes in the
highest of spirits, even though soaked to the
skin. Then shines the opportunity of the good
inn or the farmhouse with kitchen fire. One
hangs up all to dry and, sitting in a pair of
mine host’s breeches, makes mirth with a vast
platter of ham and eggs, to say nothing of a
chicken stewed in its own soup, and a bottle
of Burgundy, or a deep draught of cider, or
a Yorkshire tea. After that, one burrows deep
into the unfamiliar softness of a feather bed
and listens to the rain still pouring on the just
and the unjust outside.</p>

<p>It may happen, however, that this idyllic
dénouement is not realized; you make no house
in twenty miles. You are fain at last to get
into a stone breaker’s hut, or a wet cave or a
deserted cabin. You come to a house with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
only three rafters left of its ruined roof, and
you snuggle somehow into its one dry corner,
possibly making a fire in a convenient place
of bits of flooring, and old newspapers. By
this you dry off a little, boil your pot, and
make the best of a wet world. After all, one’s
not likely to take cold or feel any ill effects.
The open air gives strength and health to resist
cold and damp. The body goes hot as you
lie in the draught of the ruin; it finds its own
heat and will dry your shirt for you as you lie
there in the cold and the dark.</p>

<p>You find, however, that it is more cold in
a ruined or empty house than in the open. The
less ruined the house, the more cold. In some
places you come upon many empty houses.
The owners are far away; the houses are
locked, the windows shut. There is nothing
inside; every room gapes at you from its
dreary window. It is always easy to get inside.
Owners leave some door or window free.
You get in on to the kitchen sink, into the
dreary kitchen, open its further door and come
to the silent parlor, climb the stairs, half fearing
to meet a ghost, and come upon those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
weird bedchambers where no one sleeps. It
takes some nerve to settle down there for the
night. The wind whistles in the keyholes,
creeps with a knife-edge under the door,
searching your cold toes. You lie and quake,
fearing you do not know what—the house
imps, the sprites of dead children, the opening
of the dread door in front of you and the coming
in of some ghostly aged grandma, holding
a candle in one hand.</p>

<p>Not a danger, but one feels one would
scream, one would rend the roof of the house
with a great yell of horror. I have slept in
such places, but do not recall them with gladness.
The best place is to open the front or
the back door and lie down to sleep on the
threshold, looking out upon the free spacious
rain-drenched open-air world.</p>

<p>Or the tramp may seem to have better luck.
He comes in the water-washed twilight into
view of some lamp-lighted window and makes
for it, as a ship for a harbor—any port in a
storm. It is common to buoy oneself up with
unusual hopes about that window and the
home behind it. The tired man thinks of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
happy cosy home, joy in welcome, warmth in
hospitality. But too often the light proves to
be a will-o’-the-wisp. The house may be a
home, but you are not wanted there. The man
of the house will tell you of a place five miles
on where you can stay; he will tell you of a
hearsay inn, and you must trudge on till you
see another light. On such occasions the weary
wanderer may feel bitter. He feels hurt. He
feels he had a right to be taken indoors. But
he does not think of his wild looks, his forbidding
aspect, his drenched and perhaps holey
breeches. It is getting late. The man in the
desolate house is simply afraid to take him in,
fears he may be robbed in the night, or worse.</p>

<p>In these inhospitable days it is better to
use a little stealth—put one’s foot in the door,
so to speak, get a hot supper first, win a few
kind looks from the lady, talk of bed later. It
takes half an hour or so to introduce oneself
for a bed. It is only the rare chance where all
seems to have been prepared as for an expected
guest, a spare corner even laid at the
table where the family is supping, an occasion
to rejoice over and remember for a long time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
I well remember one such time when I had
been a long while in the snow, and landed up
at a desolate ranch. It was as if a long-lost
son had arrived. I was at once in the bosom
of the family with a pack of new sisters and
young brothers, to say nothing of a cowboy
father and a farm-wife mother. Very pleasant!
Rare!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap1">I</span> THINK of storms and of heavy rain and
biting wind as exceptional. They give feature
in the midst of halcyon days and nights.
The tramping life is not in caves and huts and
holes and inns, but in the open. The life opens
us with its very breadth. Is your friend too
thin; do not diet him under a white ceiling, but
give him air. Air will fill him. It is not the
air alone that cures and fills, but what you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
breathe in with the air. You breathe in the
spirit of the open. You breathe in the wideness
of the sky; you reach out to the free horizon.
It makes a man big, it builds a man
within.</p>

<p>The lark sings as it rises, conquering the
world; it is sheer joy in the open which causes
that sweet bird breast to heave in music far
in the heavens above. And as we rise, and the
earth in its grandeur falls away to right and
left, our being heaves in a life which is joy.
Ours is a bird’s happiness.</p>

<p>It is a joyous moment which delivers us
from the control of a narrow gorge. We
wind in and out of the shadow of great rocks.
Enormous cliffs hang over the way. I think,
for instance, of the great gorge of Dariel in
the Caucasus. It is interesting, but it is oppressive.
You come to it from the glorious
northern plateau, the Terek Steppes, where
there is space and sun for miles of Indian corn.
You follow the river into the gloom of the way
it has cut through the range. It is somewhat
enchanting. You come in sight of a shut-off
corner, and it calls to your feet. You must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
see what is round that corner. But when you
get there you find a road merely to another
magnetic shut-off corner. You must go on.
The next corner reveals another corner, always
darker, gloomier. The noise of the rushing
river increases as the great walls enclosing
it come nearer together. You feel yourself
becoming smaller and smaller, as if seen from
above. You and your friend are a couple of
small animals groveling at the bottom of a
pit. On the right you see the ruins of Queen
Tamara’s castle and that fatal window where
her unfortunate guests were hurled into the
river—the castle to which the Demon came.
You feel yourself on your guard, as if some
mysterious fate were in store for you. I have
slept several times in a recess below that castle,
and experienced an eerie feeling which is not
caused entirely by history and tradition, but
by something dreadful in the actual geography
of the place. Thence, however, it is a splendid
tramp up to the slopes of the great Kazbek
mountain. You get into an exalted region,
among stars and young clouds, and feel as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
you had got away from the Devil and come
nearer to God.</p>

<p>This grand open upper mountain country
is continued to Kobi, which is a little Georgian
village, hidden somewhere in a spacious basin
of rose-colored porphyry. An ideal place in
many respects. I have often thought of going
there to live for a fair space of time. But since
the War the region has become much more
dangerous to strangers.</p>

<p>Of course, it may be urged that for glorious
open country, it is hard to rival Salisbury
Plain and the Wiltshire Downs. That is true.
It is fine country for a short tramping expedition.
It widens the mind. A great thing to
have a mind as wide and tolerant as the Great
Plain, as healthy as the Downs.</p>

<p>The Steppes, however, make a greater impression—being
so vast, so wild, so untamed,
untameable. There is an exuberance of earth
which I would not miss. There is an infinity
greater than our domestic infinities. It will
soon strike you when tramping that the word
infinite does not always mean the same: there
are grades in infinity and measures of the immeasurable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Thus there is a further and
greater infinity upon the Steppes, upon the
Veldt, upon the Canadian cornlands, than, for
instance, on a clear day in the Fens.</p>

<p>There is also greater measure upward. The
tent pole of the sky is longer. Clearer air
gives a greater sense of the upward depth of
space. At night this is especially noticeable.
The stars are not pasted on black canvas, all
one level surface. There is depth in the outer
sky. You can see the planets poised; you can
see behind the moon.</p>

<p>One may dream of prison in a cave, or gain
a morbid fear of the narrowing walls of a
ravine, but open country disenchants the mind.
Freedom, room to breathe, is at least suggested
to the senses. The wind does not attack
in storm battalions, but comes equably
and large-heartedly across the plain. The
wind is a sane traveler, flicking the tops of the
grasses as you do with your staff. It does not
behave like a madman with a sword; it is not
a wild cat springing from tree to tree. Not
that you cannot get the worst of the wildness
of a wind upon the moor—but it has a quality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
that gives courage, that puts heart into a man.
Hence the Borrovian: “There’s a wind on
the heath, brother!” The wind there is one’s
friend.</p>

<p>Traveling on the Central Asian plain I remember
a steady wind that blew all night
long, as if it were engaged on the whole-time
job of keeping the starry sky polished and
swept. All night the ends of my sleeping sack
flapped in the wind and I looked through
trembling eyelashes at the moonlit snowy
peaks of the great mountain wall between the
“Tableland of Fools” and India.</p>

<p>A wind that came all the way out of the
heart of China, never ceased to blow, and yet
never raised the desert sand. The great wind
of the old world was blowing, as it has blown
for ages. It blew out of the past, turning the
monotonous page of history books, blew out
of dreams and legends of forgotten man, as
out of the storybooks of the Caliphs, a wind
which arose God knows where, far beyond the
trails of the caravans, in the heart of the East.</p>

<p>You lie in a marvelous stillness. The stars
become your men and women. You become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
a man of Chaldea, and the constellations revive.
There steals into your heart, and oh,
how you needed it, the sweet influence of the
Pleiades. Spellbound, you watch a ballet, a
story up above. There are men on elephants
and men tending camels, long strings of
camels, ropes of camels, gulf streams of
camels wending their way out of the South of
the Universe into the bleak North. There are
jeweled queens and striding harlequins and
hesitating dwarfs. There are thirteen-year-old
brides, with streaming luminous hair, riding
on high-stepping ponies, riding the ways
of the dark sky, till bid for by the heroes who
come striding along the great ways from
Arcturus.</p>

<p>The civilized world has been removed like a
table that has been cleared, a table cluttered
with papers and dishes. Civilization has been
swept to one side. You cannot see it now;
it is far away—indeed, out of your ken entirely.
You are reduced to a child—whatever
your age. You are a petted child of the universe.
You shall be all by yourself in the
midst of the world, and the Divine picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
book shall be put in your hands for you to
open, to look at, to turn the marvelous page.
So you lie there enthralled, with dilated, excited,
bright-shining eyes; just you, so many
feet by so many, and look up at infinite
breadth and infinite depth. What is a cabinet

<p><span class="dropcap1">I</span> THINK Coleridge was annoyed by the
man who interrupted him with the words
“Them’s the jockeys for me,” referring to
some steak puddings which had been brought
before his eyes. Coleridge was regarding
some choice bit of Scottish scenery, the Falls
of Clyde, I think, and a rough, unlikely-looking
fellow had used what Coleridge had considered
absolutely the right adjective concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
them—majestic—and the poet turned on
him to learn more of this verbal grace. Then
a toad leapt from the mouth of the princess
who had previously given a pearl. “Them’s
the jockeys for me,” said he, regarding the
steak puddings. It is recorded somewhere in
Coleridge’s <i>Table Talk</i>. I read it some
twenty or twenty-five years ago, and the two
expressions have remained with me—“majestic”
and “them’s the jockeys.” In fact, I
adopted the word majestic as applied to scenery
there and then, that, and the Shakespearian
“majestical.” “It seemed I did him
wrong, being so majestical.” It has almost
become a vice of style. That, however, is by
the way. The poetry of our life, and of our
book, shall be interlarded with—I may not say
puddings; one does not lard with puddings,
with the fatness of cooking and eating.</p>

<p>The dawn stars make one hungry. Noontide
makes one hungry, and so does afternoon.
The tramp is loath to tighten his belt.</p>

<p>I have described, in another book, how one
should make coffee, and I will not repeat.
But the first thing about it is love, as I wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
in a verse during my tramp with Vachel Lindsay,
“Coffee should be made with love; that’s
the first ingredient,” and “the chief cause of
coffee being just indifferent is your indifference
towards the coffee.” I feel this is also
true of the most of cooking. You must bring
a loving heart to the primus or the camp fire.
No soured personality can be trusted to stir
the beans, far less make the coffee. I have not
examined the psychology of good cooks, but
I imagine few of them are bitter, few of them
are egoists. Watch a thoroughgoing egoist
over the camp fire, cooking for <i>you</i>. But I
ask too much—take the pan from him, take
the pot away.</p>

<p>He will be saying to you, “I had a very
interesting letter from Thomas Hardy apropos
of a letter I wrote to the <i>Times</i>, approving
entirely what I said—” Meanwhile the coffeepot
has tilted on its stone and is pouring its
goodness to the ants and the beetles. It is a
miching malicho, it means mischief. You must
take over from him, let him sit himself on a
rock and pour forth, but not tend the fire and
let the coffeepot pour forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Lindsay wrote a reply to my recipe for
making coffee. His was a recipe for making
tea. He did not omit love. But as well as
tea leaves he recommended leaves of various
books to be put in the pot. I do not know
that I care for this tea from book leaves and,
I suppose, old bindings. I have had it indoors,
given me by some dusty recluse, in his portentous
library. Qua tea it was not so excellent,
qua soporific, it was good.</p>

<p>One may put in a little philosophy, however,
with both tea and coffee. “Hast any
philosophy in thee, shepherd?” We need a
little for our repast, but we want no soda to
bring out the flavor.</p>

<p>Lindsay, being an American, knew little of
tea. That is why we traveled almost exclusively
on coffee. In any case, a practical detail
to be noted, it is not wise to make coffee
and tea from the same pot. The flavors adhere
even to a very well rinsed vessel and spoil one
another. If there are two of you, each may
carry his own pot, one for tea, one for coffee.
But it is simpler to be unanimous as regards
the choice of beverage. In Russia I tramped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
almost always on tea, because the tea is so
good there and needs no milk. In some districts
milk is difficult to obtain. In America,
however, “evaporated” and “condensed” in
cans are obtainable everywhere, and are conveniently
carried. You need only make two
tiny perforations in the lid of the condensed
milk tin. You blow through one, and it drives
a thin stream of milk out at the other. You
cover these perforations with a leaf or a
piece of paper, and thus sealed, the can is carried
safely in the rucksack. Of course, if you
open with a can opener it is likely to be difficult
to keep your milk for more than one meal—or
it will make an unpleasant mixture in
your rucksack.</p>

<p>China tea has the advantage that it needs
no milk. Indeed, milk spoils it. It should be
made very weak, and it is then more refreshing
than Indian tea. I prefer a good Chinese
blend, especially on tramp. It is not, however,
possible to prepare tea in any elegant
fashion. There is no “five o’clock” in the
wilds. You brew a pot of tea at any hour
which taste suggests. The luxurious may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
carry a small teapot and merely boil the water
in the can or coffeepot. But the rougher
method is not without appeal. You can sift
two spoonfuls of tea into your coffeepot when
the water is boiling and at once take it off the
fire. A better plan is to cut off a small square
from your mosquito netting and tie the tea in
that. Your first mugful will be rather weak,
but your second, third and fourth, progressively
stronger unless you are able to pull out
the little bag of swollen tea leaves. Wash the
bit of netting, and it is ready for next time.
It will last several weeks if you do not lose it.</p>

<p>I find you can walk further after tea, but
coffee makes you more sociable. You talk
more after coffee. If Mrs. Thrale had made
the great Doctor coffee instead of tea Boswell
would have missed much more of what he said.
Though tea indoors is very different from tea
out of doors. As a domestic drink it is productive
of high spirits, but out of doors it
enkindles purpose. You walk and think and
are silent. It is good for artists and writers.
Forms and ideas rise unbidden to the mind.
What good thinking comes after the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
tea on the road—whole chapters, whole stories,
curious conceits and fancies! But after coffee
you cannot keep anything to yourself, and if
you have no companion you take to singing.</p>

<p>If, however, you are very tired or wet
through with rain, coffee has more power to
restore. It is better then to make it without
milk. Put seven or eight lumps of sugar in
the pot and heat water and sugar together, not
too much water. When quite hot, sizzling,
float a double portion or even treble portion
of coffee on top. Do not, for this potation,
use mosquito netting. The coffee should then
be watched—for it may rise suddenly and become
wasted. It is as well to stir it, and then
a useful device is the using of cross sticks. “If
you make the sign of the cross over a pot of
coffee it will not boil over,” say the cowboys.
And it is a curious fact that two dead twigs,
placed crosswise over the top of the coffeepot,
seem to cast a spell on the brew. The brew
should simmer for a quarter of an hour or
more. Then add a little cold water and stir
up. The grouts will go to the bottom, leaving
a fine liquor. Though very strong, this type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
of coffee is not bitter. You sip it; it lasts a
long while. It is much better than medicine
for you, and will drive out any amount of
damp from your system. I think it better
than coffee and rum, or warm damson gin, or
any of the concomitants of aspirin. No tramp
should carry aspirin. It is depressing to mind
and soul, and generally causes you to give up
adventures.</p>

<p>Bread and cheese and coffee make a good
combination, as of course do cake and coffee,
any sort of coffee and cake. Bread and sardine
and coffee go down very well, to say nothing
of fried trout. Directly you get your
fish, scrape it and clean it, a dirty job, but
you get used to it, wash it and fry it. If you
can eat it within a quarter of an hour of its
swimming in the stream you get some of the
hidden and lost potentialities of trout, the
inner worth of those delightful pink spots,
those scales your color-loving eye is loath to
scrape. However, remember the coffee. It
can simmer gently while you fry. Bully beef
is redeemed by coffee, so is Maconochie.
Eggs go well, but they must be fried. Boiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
eggs go better with tea. Wash them and then
boil them in the same water from which you
will make the tea. It improves the tea. But
be careful of the eggs as they boil that they
do not dance together and crack one another.
For in that case your tea water will be spoiled.</p>

<p>In Poland, and in Border States and in
Russia there are excellent hard bannocks
which soften when heated. You slit them and
insert butter. In Russia they are called
<i>bubliki</i>; they sell them in the East End of all
great cities. They go remarkably well with
tea.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden,
and Finland, there are excellent oaten and rye
cakes. They are delightful with Indian tea
and milk; not so good with China tea.</p>

<p>America, marvelous country, provides the
greatest variety of breakfast foods, cakes, and
pies in the world. What can compare with
pumpkin pie, blackberry pie, peach pie? You
go into an unromantic-looking “ville” or
“burg,” and surely come away with an unbroken
round of pie to civilize the camp
cuisine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>On a long tramping expedition one is bound
to study to some degree the body and its needs.
The Army marches on its stomach, so do you.
An attack of indigestion can make a strong
man almost too weak to move. Beware of the
cakes of bread sold in the market place in
Mohammedan cities, what in Central Asia the
Sarts and Uzbeks bake. They are difficult to
swallow, even with wine, and once inside become
a stiff indigestible mass. Millet bread is
also difficult to assimilate. Maize flour bread is
also upon occasion bad to tramp on. On the
other hand, no harm comes from any variety of
wheaten and oaten biscuit. One of the tramp’s
temptations is toward wild fruit. He can
easily make himself very unwell by eating unripe
or bitter ripe fruit—even when boiled with
sugar. Again, if the coffeepot gets dirty inside
and brown curds adhere to the side you
will find you are drinking something rather upsetting
with your coffee. There is no need to
scrub the outside of the coffeepot but cleanliness
within should be <i>de rigueur</i>. Dried apricots,
when obtainable, are ideal to take on
tramp, but they should be washed before cooking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
The stones should be broken and the
kernels thrown in with the flesh of the fruit
and some sugar—an ideal dish.</p>

<p>Potatoes are difficult to carry, but when obtained
can be easily cooked under the seemingly
dead ashes of your camp fire. They are
greatly enjoyed, as all know who have even on
a picnic roasted them and dandled them timorously
in their fingers. It is just as well to
hoist them out of the ashes on the end of a
sharpened stick. If the stick will not go in,
the potatoes are probably not yet cooked.</p>

<p>Similarly, various birds, having been
plucked of feathers, can be cooked under the
ashes. The fire ought to have been burning
an hour or so, and have accumulated much
ember before cooking a bird is tried. But a
hollow may be found for your chicken and the
ashes carefully raked and heaped over it.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the best way to cook a
young chicken is to fry it. It is easily fried
over the glowing embers and is immensely
tasty. Chicken, with a tang of wood smoke is
a feast! One cannot think of having a chicken
every day. But enough has been said to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
that the cuisine of the out-of-door life is not
utterly primitive. There is a variety of good
things for those who are not ascetics. And besides
all these good things there enter by chance
into the ménage mushrooms, so shockingly
overlooked by town-bred folk; wine, especially
the <i>vin du pays</i>, which is sometimes almost a
free gift to the wanderer; honey just taken
from the bee; Devonshire cream if you are in
the English West Country, and also bountiful
cider. There are good cheeses; though out of
door all cheese is good. You can take your
fresh <i>petit Suisse</i> along with you in France;
your Gruyère, your Stilton—there is some
good cheese in every country, and all manner
of rough cream cheeses in the mountains.
Goat-milk cheese is apt to make one very
thirsty, so one should have wine to go with
it. In America there is the never-to-be-forgotten
strawberry shortcake. You can also
get a brick of ice cream if you carry a chilling
box. In Turkish villages you can go into the
restaurants and lift such delicacies as stuffed
peppers—even the thought of them is an appetiser.
The <i>bon viveur</i> can carry with him his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
<i>petit verre</i>. Upon my honor, this tramping
business is not altogether an “eating of roots
in the desert.” Still, when provisions run out
and you are far from human habitation, you
may be reduced to eating grass. That is the
reverse side of the picture.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>

<p class="c sp lp">TOBACCO</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T has been said that whereas a pipe is a
man’s wife, a cigarette is his lady friend.
In these terms it is difficult to define a cigar,
but it will be agreed that the cigar is unnecessary
on tramp. We have no afterdinner mood.
A pipe will go a long way, the cigarette has
to be cast off and renewed—the cigar does not
enter in.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I shall hear of excellent
walkers who carried boxes of cigars in their
rucksacks and lifted the smoke of Havana to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
the noon sky. Some fellows even chew an unlighted
cigar as they walk.</p>

<p>It has frequently been said to me: “I should
think when you got to some point on your
tramps—with great views opening before you,
it was a rare place for a smoke.”</p>

<p>This moved me in my intolerant years to
much mirth. How could I share the beauties
of Nature with a pipe! I asked. It seemed
to me strange that one should wish to smoke
when the fire of one’s own thoughts was burning
brightly and streaming upward in poetic
exhalation.</p>

<p>Even now I cannot go back on my personal
experience of years past. One of the most
romantic occasions in tramping that I remember
was during a vagabondage in the Crimea,
when I reached the Gate of Baidari and
watched for an hour a marvelous changing sunset
far over the Black Sea and its mountainous
shore. It was my busiest hour of the day:
I was soaking in that sunset to the core of my
intelligence. What rapture, what prayerful
vigilance was mine then, as in the late twilight,
knapsack on back, I stood on grand platforms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
over the sea and was, as it were, alone, the one
pilgrim in the universe.</p>

<p>In those days I was a nonsmoker. But even
later when, through offering friends cigarettes,
I at last began offering them to myself, I do
not associate tobacco with great moments. It
is very delightful when riding a horse to light
a cigarette and smoke as you amble along, and
it makes a difference on a long train journey to
have the narcotic of tobacco, but to me, smoking
is not naturally associated with tramping.
One very memorable moment after I had begun
to smoke, was when I climbed out of the
jungles of Darien on the ridge where Balboa
saw the Pacific for the first time. It was pure
poetry to see the blue triangle of the Southern
Sea far o’er the forests and the hills. But
where Balboa and his men sang a “Te Deum”
I did not sit on a stone and light up a pipe.</p>

<p>However, there is no doubt that smoking
in company is a social grace. It gives a sense
of unity, and at the same time, it is a source of
some pleasure. We are always warned that
our cigarette ends have set forests afire. But
the rest of the cigarette has lighted our faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
and lightened our packs. As the soldier finds
the route march more supportable if he has
permission to smoke, so also the tramp, on a
long and arduous hill, can get much help from
cigarette or pipe. It gives patience on the
way, and then patience again in camp, while
waiting for the pot to boil. And the final
peace pipe at the end of the day settles all experiences
into a harmonious unity and prepares
the mind for the night.</p>

<p>Smoking seems to fill up the empty cells in
time—when there is nothing else to do a man
takes out a cigarette. On the other hand, after
stress or strain it soothes and it prepares the
mind for artistic work. At the same time in
writing, it seems to me, that as good literary
work can be done without tobacco as with it.</p>

<p>Upon occasion, the cigarette, and more often
the cigar, will deaden one’s sensibilities. The
effect is the rising of somber impressions,
rather than bright thinking. Tobacco has had
considerable influence on modern literature,
though it would be difficult to show just where
the difference is. It has made some writers
tolerant, but others merely laconic; helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
some to be witty, helped others to be merely
cynical. Thousands of cigarettes have gone
to the making of a novel, and it would be amusing,
and perhaps also interesting, if one could
compute the numbers that went to the various
chapters. That is not entirely irrelevant here,
for it is the custom of many writers to think
out their work while walking. They walk and
they smoke, and they think, and the ideas form.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, I smoked my first cigar
on the way to Havana, and could not finish
it. It almost finished me. I used to say that
cigars belonged to a certain later period in a
man’s life, when he had succeeded and could
lean back in his chair and view the world at
ease. It is perhaps an English idea. Cigars
in England are a luxury. But it is not so in
other parts of the world. In England, when
we smoke a cigar, we smoke largely tax. But
in other parts of the world this choicer weed
enjoys more freedom from impost. In Germany,
in Austria, in Holland, in the Indies and
Mexico, and in many other places, a cigar is no
more a luxury than a cigarette—as cheap, as
popular, and better to smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>Hood could write:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Honours have passed to men</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>My junior at the Bar.</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>No matter, I can wait,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>So I have my cigar.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but he could hardly have written—So I have
my cigarette. The cigar for us means Nirvana,
release from cares, relaxation of the whole
being. I do not think it either the meet reward
or the need of the tramp after his day’s
march. When he has had wordy warfare with
the police concerning the validity of his passport,
when he finds that he has lost all his
money and half his kit, when he has proposed
to his sweetheart and been rejected, or refused,
he may light up a Havana if he has one. But
I take comfort in the thought that unless he
has lately parted from a rich uncle he is unlikely
to have a stock of the commodity, and
will draw rather upon the resources of philosophy
which he has somehow stored within.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>

<p class="c sp lp">BOOKS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU need a book, but you cannot carry
Gibbon’s <i>Decline and Fall</i> with you,
even if you feel the need. The tramp’s
library is limited, for books are heavy. It is
best to tramp with one book only. But it is a
missed opportunity not to have one book. For
you can gain an intimacy with a book and an
author in that way, which it is difficult to obtain
in a library or in the midst of the rush of the
books of the season.</p>

<p>Each will have his choice though many will
choose alike. The inexperienced may pop the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
latest yellow-back into the rucksack, not grasping
that it will be read through in two lazy
afternoons, and that then he will have no book
to fall back upon. In the trenches in France
a happy habit developed of leaving read books
upon dry ledges in the dugouts. One often
came upon a treasure trove of the kind. But
when tramping, you cannot leave books for
others with much hope of their being found.
And rarely does one find any stray literature
unless it be some tract on the futility of sin.</p>

<p>It is better, therefore, to take with one a
whole-time book. It is good to have a book
that is full of meat, one with broad margins for
scribblings and extra pages for thoughts,
poems, thumb-nail sketches. After a long
tramp it is nice to see a book which has been
clothed with pencilings. It records in a way
the spiritual life of the adventure, and will
recall it to you when in later years you turn
over the page again.</p>

<p>It is well to take a book that you do not
quite understand, one that you have already
nibbled at but have found difficult. I do not
mean an abstruse work, but one you are just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
on the verge of understanding and making
your own.</p>

<p>At different stages of development you will
have different books. A boy just beginning
to think could do worse than take <i>The Autocrat
at the Breakfast Table</i>, or Thoreau’s
<i>Walden</i>; a little later comes <i>Erewhon</i> or
<i>Eöthen</i>. At eighteen Sartor Resartus or Carpenter’s
<i>Towards Democracy</i>, or Browning’s
“Paracelsus.” A good deal depends on temperament
as to whether a volume of Shelley
or Keats will keep you company all the while.
You read and reread a poem that you like
until it begins to sing in your mind. It becomes
your possession. There are marvelous
passages lying hidden in a poem like “Paracelsus”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Ask the gier-eagle when she stoops at once</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Into the vast and unexplored abyss,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>What full-grown power informs her from the first</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Why she not marvels strenuously beating</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>The silent, boundless regions of the sky!</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a poem of a man seeking life, seeking a
way. It ought to move most young men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
are on the threshold of life, unless they are dull
or have been infected by cynicism. For my
part, I look back loyally to the time when I
was Paracelsus and could say his lines as from
my own heart: “’Tis time new hopes should
animate the world,” I whispered as I walked,
and the new hopes were my hopes.</p>

<p>Much of “Paracelsus” should go into the
true Tramp’s Anthology, and with it, not contradicting
it, Omar Khayyam and also
O’Shaughnessy’s</p>

<div class="verse indent0"><i>Wandering by lone sea-breakers</i></div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>And sitting by desolate streams</i></div>
</div>

</div>

<p>and then certain delicious lines, untraced in

</div>

<p>An ideal book to carry on a tramping expedition
is undoubtedly an anthology of your own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
compiling, a notebook filled with your favorite
verses.</p>

<p>Other books which I think of as the tramp
grows in goodness and in grace are Ibsen’s
“Peer Gynt” or “Brand,” preferably “Peer
Gynt,” there is much more in it. “Peer
Gynt” is a very remarkable book; you can read
it ten times and still fail to exhaust its poetry,
its thought. It is a great book about life. It
is moreover a true tramping book. Peer is a
vagabond wandering about in the world, and
it is never the world which is in question, but
the state of his soul. “Brand” is not so much
of a poem as the other, and is not so memorable.
But it raises some of the eternal questions
in a powerful way. If you are “sick of
towns and men” “Brand” will rather indulge
your mood, for it speaks Ibsen’s impatience
with the petty ways and lives of average men
and women.</p>

<p>Socrates’ <i>Dialogues</i> go well in the inner
pocket, and so do Horace’s <i>Odes</i>, if you are of
a Horatian turn of mind and can read them.
There are many, especially in Scotland, who
like to take a Homer, and fancy themselves on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
the hills of Greece. For a classical scholar
there are many books of profound and lasting
interest; a Plotinus will last you a long while.
For you have not merely to read it, but to resurrect
a being who lived centuries ago in a
different civilization. The human heart was
the same, but almost everything else had a
difference.</p>

<p>If the mind is just attracted to ancient
philosophy, I know few books to compare with
Pater’s <i>Plato and Platonism</i>, for inner worth.
I do not, however, think his <i>Marius</i> a good
tramping book. Nature rebels against its cold
chaste beauty. It needs, I think, a more artificial
setting for its enjoyment.</p>

<p>Few novels are good tramping books. One
gets through the story so quickly, and if there
is no more than story there, the book is finished
with. Still, there are a few knapsack
companions worth having, such as <i>The Cloister
and the Hearth</i>, <i>John Inglesant</i>, <i>Wilhelm
Meister</i>, Dostoieffsky’s <i>The Brothers Karamazoff</i>.
All rather bulky, I am afraid, for ideas,
though they keep other books thin, do swell
the volume of a novel. A few ideas stated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
conversation and baited with picturesque descriptions
take three times the space they need
in the essay. It is sometimes easier to understand
them, but the expression is diffuse.</p>

<p>Plays, however, come near to being ideal.
They take up little space. The dramatist has
to censor his own work vigorously with a view
to cutting down the excess of verbiage which
his ideas naturally claim. He is forced into
paradox and epigram. His work is full of
hints and suggestions which are undeveloped.
It is for you to develop them. As Ibsen said,
“I ask the questions; it is for you to answer
them.”</p>

<p>A Shakespeare play is a delightful library.
I nearly always take one. A drama like
<i>Richard III</i> or <i>Othello</i> can be read over and
over again. <i>As You Like It</i> and <i>A Midsummer
Night’s Dream</i>, are the great open-air
plays. You learn more about them with
the birds and the stars to teach you than with
the aid of the most genial producer or inspired
professor. You make your camp in a natural
theater among the trees, or in an arena among
the rocks. There is an audience not altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
invisible. It waits, it has its programs, you
have the book of the words and the brain full
of moving figures. Sun and moon are working
the limelight from the wings. Your camp
fire is the footlights. Enter Man. Enter
Hamlet. Enter Julius Cæsar, the gods, the
ghosts. The tramp becomes an ancient type,
a magician, a mystagogue—with a Shakespeare
in his hand, in the midst of the worlds.</p>

<p>If modern drama rouses the fancy, you can
take a Pirandello or a Shaw, and thresh it out—get
a real opinion about it. It is worth
while when you have to orientate your mind to
certain writers of repute to make yourself
intimate with at least one of their works.</p>

<p>I suppose some may prefer to read a book
on the country through which they are tramping,
and in that case a librarian’s aid may be
sought. There are now scores of volumes on
almost every country in the world. It is as
well to look over several of them before making
a choice—many prove to be slapdash, ill-informed
compositions.</p>

<p>Does one take accounts of travel in lands
other than that one is tramping in? I imagine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
not. <i>Unknown Arabia</i> is out of place in a
tramp through California. But a tramp’s account
of his own life is interesting reading
anywhere, and one naturally thinks of W. H.
Davies’ autobiography in this connection.
There are few tramp writers. But probably
the best short story of Maxim Gorky’s tells of
his tramping life, and is called “The Fellow
Traveller.” Jack London’s <i>Valley of the
Moon</i> contains some tramping episodes. Jack
London, Rudyard Kipling, Cunninghame
Graham, Belloc, Chesterton, Carl Sandburg,
Vachel Lindsay, are all delightful writers in
the tramping mood and ask a place in the
knapsack. Then there are Harry Franck’s
untiring pedestrian tours in Patagonia, China,
and elsewhere, perhaps in too ponderous a
form as yet for field use.</p>

<p>I once met a tramping publisher, <i>rara avis</i>,
a very black swan; he began his life as a colporteur
of the British and Foreign Bible Society
and spent twenty years on the road,
going from Bibles to leaflets, which he printed
himself, and thence to booklets, thence to books
and an office and a vast organization. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
a simple way of business. I handed him a
manuscript; he opened a drawer and handed
out a wad of notes, and the transaction was
concluded without a word in writing. But I
suppose that was unusual even in his business.
There was a savor of tramp meeting tramp in
the affair.</p>

<p>The Bible colporteur ought, at least, to
know one book the better for his calling.
When all is said, there is one book more worth
taking than all the rest; poetry, philosophy,
history, fantasy, treatise, novel, and drama,
you have all in one in the Bible, the inexhaustible
book of books. You need not take it all,
take the prophecies, the Psalms, the Gospels.
It means much to tramp with one Gospel in
the inner pocket of the coat.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>

<p class="c sp lp">LONG HALTS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F your tramping expedition is long; if you
have voted yourself plenty of time; if, for
example, you are taking a wander year, you
are under no compulsion to keep on tramping.
One advantage of being a true Bohemian is
that you are under no compulsion except that
of the heart. You stop when you like, you go
on when you like. You surely come to places
in which you are tempted to remain—be it
only for a few days. You stay a day, and the
place grows on you; you stay longer. And
then, when the spirit moves, you move with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
it, move on, enriched by your delay, by your
idleness.</p>

<p>There are short halts and long halts. The
short ones are simple and natural; the longer
ones more difficult to make, but not to be foregone
on that account. You come at last to the
ideally simple, or beautiful, or alluring village.
You ought to stay there a while, make home
there for a while. And you have only your
tramping kit and no word to recommend you.
Still, it can be arranged, and the very modesty
of your approach should help you. You come
from below, not from above; the villagers will
not hide their life from you. They may be
shy of the stranger, but shyness will wear off
as they watch you in their midst.</p>

<p>Do not go to the local priest who, being a
responsible person, is likely to tell you that it
is impossible to stay there and to fill your
mind with difficulties. You want to get taken
in and hire a room. You have money to pay
for it. You should make your appeal direct
at the house where you would like to stay.
You shall be very civil to the lady, and drink
with mine host. It can be arranged. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
will even put themselves to trouble on your
behalf.</p>

<p>It is so much better to be in a family than
in an inn. Inside the little family of a home
you are inside the bigger family of the village,
and if you are a sociable soul you will soon
have many friends. You will get to know the
village characters and gossips, the village children,
the village musicians; the stories of the
village, its legends, its superstitions—and
then, its love affairs, its family entanglements,
its coming weddings and fêtes.</p>

<p>All this is worth while in the science of living.
It is part of a true tramping jaunt to
come back from Nature to man, not of need
to civilization, but to men and women and
children. The village children will prove as
near to the wanderer’s heart as the birds in
the woods—nearer, for they are wood fairies
incarnate, trapped on the edge of the forest
and made to live human lives in the villages.</p>

<p>The written pages of your notebook grow
in the village, on the long halt, as do also the
unwritten yet unfading memories within.
Days and weeks tramping in the open crystallize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
in impression, and your past is like a
tapestry on your bedroom wall. There is a
space cleared for human life and love and happiness,
for dance and for song, for sociality
and talk.</p>

<p>Here is opportunity for learning new ways
of life and new stories and songs. You may
soak in folklore and folk music for weeks.
How splendid for you if, when the time comes
to go away and resume your trampings you
can carry away with you drawings you have
made, songs you have learned to sing, stories
which you can tell. You will carry that village
with you to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>And then, of course, a village is not merely
a village, not merely the broad and rutted
roads and the cottages planted among the pigs
and fowls. The village has its ways out, its
views, its hillsides and streams, its loveliness
on all sides. Your long halt is not a sitting
still in a human settlement, but a starwise tour
of all the country round about.</p>

<p>Going on and on in a line of route has its
drawbacks. The world is not a straight line,
not even a crooked line, not even the line of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
man’s steps upon it—it is an area, a broad
surface. Length cannot exist without some
measure of breadth, but at the risk of a paradox
one may say the world is breadth without
length.</p>

<p>So also man’s life. We think of it in length
of years. But that in a way is error. Life is
not length of time, but breadth of human experience.
Life is not a chain of events, but
an area-something spreading out from a hidden
center and welling at once towards all
points of the compass.</p>

<p>In the long halt, therefore, one has not
stopped living, because one has ceased going
onward. You get poised on your center.
You feel the origins of joy and pain—deep
down at the heart’s core, the place from which
something in you is welling up all the while,
welling up and overflowing, flowing away in
waves and tides, to break on a mystical shore.</p>

<p>Belike you have a child’s happiness into
which you are unwilling to probe. You ask
not whether it is more in one thing than in
another. You tramp and you are happy, and
halt and you are happy. Or happiness is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
your word for what you feel, not your vein.
You muse, you are at one with life, you are
content, you ask only to go on in the way in
which you are. Or your happiness is to feel a
divine melancholy wherever you are. It is the
same for all. The long halt, the dwelling
among strange kindred, the choosing of some
spot to be beloved in preference for a while—that
also enters into the art of life, of the life of
the true Bohemian and life-wanderer.</p>

<div class="verse indent0"><i>“You are not taking up with a dirty foreigner?”</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>“He’s quite a decent fellow, though he is a foreigner.</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Why do you say ‘dirty foreigner’?”</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>“All foreigners are dirty foreigners.”</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>O the majority of Englishmen foreigners
are dirty foreigners, though, of course,
to Americans, one concedes the name cousin.
But when you travel about in the world you
soon find that in other countries we also are
foreigners, perhaps even “dirty foreigners.”</p>

<p>“He is English?” I have heard it asked.
“He’s one of these people who think they own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
the earth?” And all too often in Europe one
hears of “vulgar Americans.”</p>

<p>Despite the grand international ideas of this
and of preceding ages, it is just as difficult for
foreigners to get on together and esteem one
another and understand one another. This
becomes very clear upon reading modern
works of travel, and perhaps clearer still upon
listening to the personal adventures of people
who have been traveling unconventionally in
foreign lands. What is strange to us is comic,
it strikes us as a burlesque; if it irks us we
think it distasteful, even wrong. We take
the foreigner to task for not behaving “like
a perfect gentleman,” etc.</p>

<p>It is largely a matter of bad manners. If
manners could be improved we should more
easily get into sympathy with “foreigners”;
if they could be perfected there would not be
any foreigners.</p>

<p>The language difficulty is enormous. Even
if we learn to speak a foreign tongue, we are
liable to make mistakes and to have a queer
accent. We are at least as bad as those
foreigners who come to us and say “English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
as she is spoke.” Mistakes in language are
almost always very malapropos. <i>Beaucoup</i> is
“much” in France, but ill-pronounced it
means “little” in Italian (<i>poco</i>). The word
for Thursday in Serbian is slang for sixpence
in Russian. An American lady wishing to
ingratiate herself with some Germans said she
felt as if in Paradise; but the word paradise
in German means tomato, and her friends
stared at her. An acquaintance of mine, not
speaking French very well, was dancing on a
Paris boulevard with some <i>midinettes</i>. Feeling
rather tired he went up to one of them and
whispered in her ear, “<i>Ma chère danseuse, je
suis en couchant</i>” so that he seemed to imply a
confession that he was a pig. Two Russian
Bolsheviks in London were fumbling for a
doorkey outside a house at midnight. A policeman
came up and asked them what they were
doing.</p>

<p>“I have forged a key,” one of them replied.
The bobby, however, looked at them indulgently.
“<i>Forgot</i>, you mean,” said he emphatically.</p>

<p>But difficulties of this kind are not confined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
to foreign wanderings. You can experience
them at home, in Scotland, for example, or on
the burring border, or even in Yorkshire. I
was tramping across Yorkshire one summer,
and I realized how outlandish my English
sounded. They speak a different language up
there. I had to make every one repeat everything
twice. They frequently mistook what
I said. They made me say it twice also. They
reckoned I did not come from these parts.</p>

<p>I went into an inn one night and asked for
a room.</p>

<p>The landlady, an elderly dame with a huge
red face, asked me if I meant a room.</p>

<p>I said “Yes.” She said, “Ted, this gentleman
wants a room.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he exclaimed, “in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Mine will be my usual drop o’ Scotch,”
said an old fellow, nudging me as he went past.</p>

<p>I sat down in the bar parlor.</p>

<p>Presently the young man came and inquired
if I’d like water in my room.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” I answered patiently.</p>

<p>Then, in a few minutes, the young man Ted
came in, mixing as it seemed to me a cocktail—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
what might pass for a cocktail in Yorkshire.
He stood in front of me, wineglass in
hand, and poured a clear liquid on to a brown
one, cautiously and professionally.</p>

<p>“Tell me when to stop,” he said.</p>

<p>“That’s not for me?” I queried. And I
wondered if it was perhaps a custom to bring
guests an unsolicited cocktail as a ritual of
welcome. Yorkshire has its festive ways.</p>

<p>But the boy stopped stirring and pouring,
and looked at me.</p>

<p>“It must have been somebody else,” he remarked,
and turned to the red-faced landlady.</p>

<p>She faced me. “Yes,” she said hoarsely,
“you ordered the room.”</p>

<p>Then the truth dawned on me.</p>

<p>“I asked for a room,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, here it is,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“Not a rum, but a room! Room! Room!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, room,” said the landlady.</p>

<p>“A room for the night, a lodging,” I explained.</p>

<p>“Oh, a bed,” said she, with a chagrined face.
“We have no beds. No, no beds,” and I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
see her thinking the matter over in her mind,
the difference between room and rum. She
watched to see if I would drink what had been
put before me.</p>

<p>But rum is not my drink, especially after a
day’s tramp. I shouldered my knapsack and
pushed out of the inn under the disdainful
gaze of the red-faced landlady and the stare
of the man who was sipping his drop of Scotch.</p>

<p>They say the better educated people of
Edinburgh speak the best English in Great
Britain, and I certainly can use my own tongue
fairly well. But judge my amazement when
I first went to America, and was told I did
not speak English. I was tramping to Chicago,
and men on the road would say to me,
“Say, you haven’t been over here long. You
speak the language broken.”</p>

<p>Prejudices are bred over the difference of
saying the word “well” with the lips and
“well” with the throat. Even a national laugh
can be aggravating. “Haw, haw, there’s a
merry laugh for you,” says the American in
“So This is London,” “haw-haw—the marmalade
hounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Incidentally, that sentence from a clever
play points to the other great cause of irritating
difference in ways. The Americans do
not take marmalade for breakfast. We do.
It is almost a source of international misunderstanding.</p>

<p>“The English have such bad table manners,”
I used to hear said in Moscow. And
yet you should see Ivanovitch with his soup.
We are too greedy at table. We accept second
and third helpings, only intended to be
offered, not intended to be taken. We do not
know how to make a glass of tea and a saucer
of jam last fifty minutes. We eye the samovar
when we want more tea. We do not kiss our
hostess’s hand after the repast. Americans
eat with their hats on, but with their coats
off. Russians smoke cigarettes between
courses. Frenchmen take large towels into
their collars, and pick their teeth with toothpicks
while they talk. All very disgusting.
Almost every variation in ways of eating is
distasteful.</p>

<p>The tramp, the wanderer in strange lands,
should at least get over this. I am sure Oliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Goldsmith and George Borrow, two delightful
wanderers, never fell foul of any one for lack
of speech or eating wrongly. They knew how
to counteract the effect of their own foreignness,
and how to accept and enjoy differences
in others.</p>

<p>But unless the tramp intends to shun men
and women altogether he has to face the problem
of liking his fellow man, however unlike
to himself. It is part of the art of tramping
to know how to meet your fellow man, how to
greet him, how to know him.</p>

<p>You get a companion who calmly tells you
he intends to “pick your brains” during the
tramp. That is very well, though the expression
seems not too kind. It is easier to say
“I intend to get to know you during our
wanderings together”—though there, of
course, the intention is towards something very
difficult. It takes a long time to know a man.
You may “pick his brains” in half an hour and
not get to know him in a lifetime. It is mawkish
for a man to talk of love, except in love,
but it needs a loving heart to know any one
really well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>The man you tramp with is not a foreigner,
albeit foreign enough in himself, as you may
discover before you discover he is kindred.
You are thrown into intimate contact with
him. Even if the two of you are a couple of
egoists strongly self-centered, something is
bound to get across in a long tramp. That
is one reason why tramping is such a healthful
spiritual experience. The too-too-solid
flesh does melt a little, the too-too-solid
heart does warm somewhat toward an outsider.</p>

<p>But the chance-met is much more difficult
to meet, to greet, to understand. Of course,
more difficult for some than for others. There
are genial sympathetic souls who have an aptitude
for taking a stranger at once to the
heart. They are bright-eyed people, friendly
at once and friendly for a long while. I have
a prejudice in their favor—but, alas, there are
not very many of them. The warmest thing
in the world is human affection; it is the most
covetable, and it is the sweetest thing to give.
And it is also the saddest thing to have refused.
I believe the affectionate people take the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
blows in life. But also they get the greater
rewards.</p>

<p>Still, there is shyness, timidity, stand-offishness,
which commonly mask the souls of
very friendly people. It is difficult to rid oneself
of these defective qualities. Much travel
frequently does it, and much tramping will do
it also. Tramping simplifies out many of our
foibles. It makes the artificial people more
natural. I have seen a man afraid almost of
his own shadow in town become a bold and
smiling boy upon the road, not afraid to meet
any one and hold frank converse with him.</p>

<p>Chance meetings may greatly enrich human
experience, especially in a foreign country
where one has so much to learn of the ways of
one’s fellow man. I have found by personal
experience that one of the quickest ways in
which to learn the life of a people is by tramping
among them.</p>

<p>The commonest way of attempting to make
a study of a new nation is to arrive at the
capital city with a wallet full of introductions
to notable people. You stay at the best hotel,
call at the Embassy, make friends with one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the secretaries, dine with him and learn his
prejudices, go on the morrow to a friend of
his, who will tell you “all you need to know.”
Then you may use your introductions, checking
off what the native notabilities say about
their country by what you have already heard.</p>

<p>The visitor of this type does get impressions.
That is undoubted. He feels that he is
getting to know the new country very pleasantly,
and yet, when his visit is over and he
returns home, if he is frank with himself he
must confess that he has very little real knowledge
of the people. He is obliged to say—Well,
I was only there for six weeks; I cannot
pretend that I know much about it. But
sixty weeks of that sort of thing would make
little difference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, six weeks tramping gives
you unforgettable impressions of reality. You
have the great advantage of facing society
from the outside of its classes. You are at the
bottom of the social system and have the freedom
from pride which such a position implies.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>’Tis pride that pulls the country down</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Then take thy auld cloak about thee.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>You do not need to put on airs, put on side,
ape pompous acquaintances, simper, trim,
bowdlerize, change clothes according to time
of day, polish finger nails and balance cake,
give the expected smile after futile remark,
avoid contradiction, or read up the secrets of
bon ton at night.</p>

<p>As you come along the road at any time
of day everything about you says, “Here I am,
the tramp; take me as I am or not at all.”
The Church covers the friar so that he is immune
from pride and taunt, fashion and convention.
He cannot be reproached; for his
garments are a token that he is bearing the
reproach of Christ. And Nature covers the
tramp in a similar way. He has the chance
to feel and be at home in any place in the
world, under any circumstances and with any
people. You are never ill-dressed in the
King’s uniform; you are never ill-dressed in
the tramp’s.</p>

<p>Such stability is great gain, and frees the
mind from care and fear of appearances. You
can with a gay heart plunge into converse with
the heir to the kingdom if he comes your way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
and he will almost infallibly say after his long
revealing talk with you: “Ah, I wish I were
you!” You cause kings to envy you, but even
peasants, who can be prouder and stiffer than
kings, will feel at home with you. You must
also be at home with them. You learn their
accent, their special peasant version of life,
their stories, their songs. Quite by accident
you seem to get inside the real life of a nation
and you belong to it for the time. “It is always
worth while talking to a clever man,”
says a character in Dostoyevsky. It is always
worth while talking to a stranger.</p>

say a few words about ourselves. I think it
is Novalis says: “The world—all nature—is
an encyclopædical index of our own souls.”
If you would read the cypher of your soul you
must use the cypher key of Nature. If you
would learn and read the language of the
heart, the world, the visible universe, shall be
your dictionary.</p>

<p>When Richard Jeffries wrote <i>The Story of
My Heart</i> it proved to be all birds, flowers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
bees, grasses, skies and trees and airs. It was
no cinema story, no Tarzan romance. Nor
was it booklore. He did not go to the British
Museum to obtain materials for the story of
his heart, did not “mug it up” with the help of
great authorities. But in the wild woods and
on the Wiltshire hills he spelt it out with his
fingers letter by letter, like a blind man fingering
Braille.</p>

<p>I sometimes think that the gold of all literature
and art is self-expression of this kind, and
that after all, the best passages and the best
pictures are “<i>impressions de voyage</i>.” After
we die we may be set to write an essay on our
life story. It will be “<i>impressions de voyage</i>.”
Fifty years in an office will be found shriveled
up to a dot, and a few days in the wilds will
expand into the whole essay.</p>

<p>Why do we stare at beautiful things? We
see them—is that not enough, can we not
merely glance and pass on? We stop and we
stare, at that mountain side, at that flower, at
that dreaming lake. We cannot pass at once.
We seem to be looking intently, stargazing at
something further off and yet more kindred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
than the stars, but we are not using our physical
eyes. Perhaps we are not using our eyes
at all. We are listening. Nature is trying to
tell us something; she is speaking to us on a
long-distance wave.</p>

<p>Your mind is haunted. You have forgotten
something, and the flower is trying to tell you.
It is reminding you of a forgotten air. Something
you cannot quite hear, cannot quite make
out. Once you belonged to a kingdom where
... once you knew some one young and fair
... once you were lost, still lost, always
lost.... But you could join us yet, did you
dare ... what is the flower trying to say?
What does the mountain say, and the lone bird
on the branch? The heart aches. You lie on
the downs; heaven is alive with birds. The
bosom of the sky heaves with their song. And
you, down below on the cropped grass of the
hills, lying on the chalk, shading the eyes with
a hand, look up—and the heart aches. It
aches with homesickness, with love for that
some one of whom the flowers speak and the
lark sings.</p>

<p>You are camped by the side of a stream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
and a boatman goes past in his boat in the
dusk; you are dreaming by your fire in the
morning, and a wild bird comes unbidden to
your wrist; you are yourself mirrored in the
water below a rock just before you are about
to plunge; you watch an eagle bridge a chasm
with its flight; you see cliffs shaped like giants
and trees like dwarfs. The snake serpentines
through the dust across your path, drawing a
line—thus far and no further—which, however,
you overstep. You find yourself treading
in primeval forest, where no step of man
has ever been heard before. The trees change
into great armies marching upward in platoons,
in serried battalions. You come to great
walls—termini. You overclimb them: death,
new life. You are out of touch with below.
It is the great plateau: you can yearn upward
with your hands, you cannot yearn downward
to those you have left below. Lark’s song
comes up to you from other people’s heaven.
You are in upper mountain country among
glaciers and scarred rocks, amid frogs, amid
storms. You dance in the air with the snowflakes.
The soul plumbs the depth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
world with a sad thought dropped from the
height. Listen—the little avalanches—a crack,
a rumble, a thudding, a whispering. You
reach and stand astride the pass between two
countries. God divided up the world, and you
are a pair of compasses in His hand.</p>

<p>The first tramp left Eden many years ago.
They say he died. But to my mind he is still
wandering. God made him wander. He has
wandered so far his wits are wandering too.
He doesn’t remember much about the garden
now. It was a pleasant place. It had a snake
in it, however. Very pleasant: a place in which
one could lie down and rest for an eternity at
a time, if it were not for the snakes in the
grass. The devil got loose in it. Still, it was
the only place in which one could feel at home
for ever and ever. And outside of it one must
wander. Life is a wandering and a seeking
where it was once a sitting still and an adoring.</p>

<p>So the tramp’s life is a type of existence.
I like the symbolism of the Jewish Passover,
the standing dressed for departure into the
wilderness. Man is not man sitting down; he
is man on the move. <i>Le tramp c’est l’homme.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>Even if in small measure the tramp is a pilgrim.
His adventure is a spiritual adventure
or it is nothing. The clouds part and Orion
is disclosed. The rude pencilings are erased
and the main curve remains, and the curve of
your adventure is a broken arc. “On earth
the broken arc; in heaven the perfect round,”
says Browning. But given the arc the center
can be found. We revolve about the sun, but
there are planets revolving around a sun invisible
to us. Our souls, I suppose, revolve
about some invisible spiritual sun which we
are always thinking about—a center called
God.</p>

<p>So with all our hilarity, our joyous meetings,
our madcap doings, with all the fun of
the tramping expedition there is the deeper
interest underlying all. Most people will
make the tramp without one conscious deeper
thought. It does not matter. Their nature
is getting something intuitively, although the
mind has no knowledge of it. The gay undergraduate,
all vim and no soul, shies at religion
and has no thought except about climbs, leaps,
jumps, food, sporting chances, pedestrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
achievement! He may not see this glorious
jaunt in a poetic light until years afterwards.
Cunninghame Graham remarks in one of his
clever prefaces that nothing in the present
ever seems so good as what is past. Some
years pass, and your present, which is silver
to-day, becomes gold in recollection. You lie
in a matter-of-fact mood under the stars in the
midst of the mountains. Your mind is at rest,
you ask for nothing beyond perhaps good
sleep, and belike you thank neither God nor
yourself for having got there. But ten years
later you look back with a sigh and say “How
wonderful it was, ah, I was happy then!”</p>

<p>The intuitive understanding rises slowly to
the mind, like light traveling from a distant
planet to this earth. But you get it at last
and see.</p>

<p>So the experience is kindred for all manner
of minds. The poet may exult too feverishly
at first, and grow tired of his own rhapsodies;
the reflective intellectual may become bored by
his own meditations. But neither the poetic
rhapsodies nor the intellectual notes record
the measure of the tramp. For it is a measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
of hidden honey that is being stored, and you
are seldom allowed by Nature to eat of your
own store day by day. We are bees rather
than wasps.</p>

<p>The true beehive of inner experience is in
you, and yet, of course, there are what may be
called auxiliary beehives. I believe the conscious
experience of a tramp can be greatly
increased in a pleasurable way by the use of
notebooks. It is worth while keeping a record
if only to remind yourself in other years. The
details of your spiritual adventures fade out
unless you have a good memory or an <i>aide-mémoire</i>.
The whole work of some writers is
no more than a tramp’s notebook, Blake, for
instance, a series of marvelously scrawled
hieroglyphics—the story of his journey from
one world to another. But one does not need
to be a “writer” as it is called, or an “artist.”
It is a spurious classification. We are all
writers and artists from the day when we
scrawl with our toy spades in the wet sand to
the day when we put the seal of death to our
wills. Man as such is an artist. Being public,
being printed, being exhibited, are matters connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
with the minor function of being professionally
artistic. Giotto drew a perfect
circle to show what he could do. We shall
draw imperfect ones and be more true to Art.</p>

<p>The fact is he has lost a great deal who has
not kept a daybook of the soul. Something
very sweet happened to Leigh Hunt one day
and he wrote.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Time you thief who love to get</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Sweets into your list, put that in.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was entered in his daybook. Certain happenings
make a day worth while and perhaps
forever memorable to you. “To-day I knew
that I had conquered all my doubtings,” wrote
Carlyle once in his diary, recording his transit
from scepticism to positive belief. It was an
entry in his daybook.</p>

<p>As a practical detail, I love page-a-day
diaries, the new sort used mostly in America
and France. It is a nicely bound thin-paper
book with a whole page for each day in the
year and no postal information or cash columns.
Unfortunately in England such books
are generally bound to look like Bibles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
have appropriate Scripture references at the
head of each page. One is reminded of the
Lessons and the Collects. That is very well,
but we require a minimum of printed matter
on our daily page. It is ours, like our life
when we wake up in the morning, free and
open, and we may write there only what is
given to us personally to write. Such a notebook
should be free from conventions. If we
wish to draw sketches in it mixed with written
notes, we will. If we need to overstep the
limits of a page we will find a less-covered
page among our yesterdays and let to-day
spill over to fill out the measure of time past.
If you have had a tramping expedition in the
midst of an otherwise sedentary year how the
empty pages will fill up from the more glorious
days!</p>

<p>The artist’s notebook is free for sketches,
notes, impressions of moments, <i>bon mots</i>,
poems, things overheard, maps and plans,
names of friends and records of their
idiosyncrasies, paradoxes, musical notations,
records of folksongs and other songs which you
copy in order that you may sing for years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
afterwards. But it should not contain too
much banal detail, such as petty accounts, addresses,
druggists’ prescriptions, number of
season ticket and fire-insurance policy, memos
to send rent. These things are apt to clutter
up your book, and when you come to Old
Year’s Night, and sit waiting for the chime
of bells which rings in another year—and you
have your daybook before you, and you go
over its pages, you do not want to pause on
a scrawled laundry list or some Falstaffian
account of wine and bread consumed at such
and such an inn.</p>

<p>The artist’s daybook is his own living gospel—something
coming after Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John—and should be sacred to him,
if he is not merely a flippant and cynical fellow
seeing life in large part as a buffonade.</p>

<p>A thought recorded, one that is your own,
written down the day when it occurred, is a
mental snapshot, and is at least as valuable as
the photographs you may take on your
journey. Yesterday’s thought is worth considering
again, if only as the stepping stone of
your dead self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>The thoughts of some people are constant,
but of others varying and contradictory. It
is like landscape. Some live their lives in the
sight of a great range of mountains—they live
in the presence of certain ever-abiding
thoughts; others change their mental scenery
from day to day, in the shallows and flats of
the low country. But we all have our epochal
days, our epochal thoughts. We turn to a
page in our notebook and say: “On this day
the thought occurred to me in the light of
which I have lived ever since.” You draw
two candles there, with light rays, to show the
thought of the year.</p>

<p>It is much the same if the expression of the
thought has been given you by another. Your
thought of the year may take the form of a
quotation. Those who search while they read
naturally find in the expression of others what
their souls need. I remember long periods of
living with certain thoughts derived from
books—Browning’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>He placed thee midst this dance</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Of plastic circumstance</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>This present thou forsooth would’st fain arrest.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>and then at another time Richter’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“<i>We are near awakening when we dream that we dream.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Persistent thoughts on a path of life’s pilgrimage!
Morning after morning one
awakens and the thought awakens with one
and goes through the day in company, in communion
with one.</p>

<p>Each day Nature puts her magic mirror in
our hands. “Oh child, do you see yourself
to-day?”</p>

<p>We look, we look, and answer wistfully,
“Not to-day, not to-day.”</p>

<p>Is it that the reflection is dim and vague,
or that our eyes have not yet cleared? Shortsighted
people see curious distortions of themselves
in the glass.</p>

<p>But it may even be true that no one has yet
seen his own face. You can never be sure that
what you see in a glass is what other people
see in your face. So also in the spiritual
mirror of Nature, one seeks to identify oneself
and yet never is satisfied. Cheek and nose
are wandering with the ripples of the lake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Every pool in the marsh has its star reflections,
and as you bend o’er one of them your visage
is broken by the starlight.</p>

<p>On the desolate North Cape, amid ice floes
and leaping seals, with the bleak homeless
winds of the Arctic about your ears, you are
as near to your own image as in the warmth
of Gibraltar’s opening gates. In the center
of the Great Pyramid your heart turns to dust,
but coming forth it vivifies again and is young
as the year of your age. Pharaoh’s uncovered
face is a faded hieroglyphic, but still it asks
thousands of years after death—who am I;
whither do I go?</p>

<p>So life’s scroll is full of question marks,
pointers, index fingers, records of bearings,
soundings, answers and partial answers to the
question: Where am I? Drake climbs a
goodlie and high tree in Darien and descries
afar the Southern Sea. It is a picture in his
artist’s notebook. Such an artistic thing to
do, and life made him do it! It was no pose,
his going forth to singe the King of Spain’s
beard. It was more of a pose, I think,
when he refused to allow his game of bowls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
to be interrupted by the approach of the
Armada.</p>

<p>Pose is, unfortunately, a prevalent disease
of the quest. Some natures are betrayed to
striking attitudes on the top of molehills.
To-day I conquered the Mendips; henceforth
there are no Mendips. But good hard, earnest
living—tramping and seeking, will cure most
people of the false theatrical. Beware of going
to Jerusalem in order that you may come back
and tell the world you have been. It spoils all
you found on the way. I do not like the
palmers; those who have been and have come
back. Admitted that it is a vice of ourselves,
we professional <i>littéraires</i>, we go and then partially
spill over when we return, selling the
wine of experience for so much. When it is
genuine experience you well may:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Wonder what the vintners buy</i></div>
<div class="verse indent0"><i>One half so precious as the goods they sell.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, of course, one can tell one’s story and
yet escape pose. “Make thyself small,” saith
Buddha. Make thyself unobtrusive, lest some
one may think that a very ornate and luxurious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
loud speaker is responsible for the music itself.
In an old-fashioned phrase so difficult to
stomach nowadays—“Give God the glory.”</p>

<p>The personal diary, however, that daybook
of the soul, is not meant for other gaze. I
should imagine oneself shy even of the eyes of
one’s most intimate friend, wife, sweetheart,
<i>alter ego</i>. There is a delicacy, a secrecy about
the functions of mind and soul. You do not
wish others to see what you have written and
blush at the thought of half a line being read
over your shoulder. And the better the diary
is kept the more private and personal it becomes.</p>

<p>I do not consider Pepys’ Diary to be the
type of a good daybook, though it is extremely
valuable as a record of the life of the age in
which Pepys lived. It is one of the great
curiosities of literature. As after a lifelong
imprisonment one might find the diary of a
prisoner, written to kill time, so after Pepys’
life one finds this astonishing document, wherein
as it were, <i>all</i> is written down. But that
all of Pepys’ Diary is not all. It is all that is
immaterial. There is much that escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
Pepys because he was not on the lookout for
it. The chief omissions are the answers or
attempted answers to the questions: “Who
was Pepys? Whom did Pepys think he was?”
The answers to these questions covering the
whole of Pepys’ life could well occupy as much
space as the famous diary we have.</p>

<p>But Pepys, perhaps without intention, described
his England very well. He set down
so much detail that he provided something resembling
cinema films of daily life. As you
read his pages you drop away from your own
century and walk in his. His work is not a
selection of phenomena; you make your selection
from it. You can, in fact, make a diary
from his diary. His many pages become one
page, or half a page, in your diary.</p>

<p>There was in Russia, up to the Revolution,
in which he perished a Pepysian writer, more
selective, it is true, but determined to write
down <i>all</i>, everything that occurred to him
from day to day through life. He became
naturally voluminous, and put down all manner
of things, discreet and indiscreet, some very
shocking to decent minds. But in one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
later volumes of fragments and thoughts he
wrote, “It may be asked what possible interest
is there is these things I am recording, but
that is my affair. For a long while now I
have been writing without reader. If some one
reads, that is his lookout; I do not invite him.
One resolution I have made, and will carry
out, and that is to print <i>all</i>.” So many of his
daybook entries have curious tags after them,
such as “Written on my cuff at Mme. So-and-So’s
reception”; “Written while waiting for
the tram on Nevski.”</p>

<p>It is fair to him to say that he only recorded
thoughts and observations. If he was making
love to a Captain’s wife at any time he did not
tell of it—but only gave current reflections on
love and what women really are. His whole
literary output makes one spiritual notebook.</p>

<p>Few people however have much persistence.
The January mood is familiar; this
year I will keep a diary. The February pages
of most diaries look pale and consumptive.
March may pass without a single entry, as if
throughout that glorious month nothing of
moment had passed before one’s eyes or occurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
to one’s being. That is not, however,
such a default as may appear. One drops the
diary; one resumes it. To-day I take stock of
life and thought and all good things that are
mine; to-morrow I will swing all day on the
garden gate singing a nursery rhyme; the day
after I shall put on my silk hat and go to the
city and a company meeting; I shall promenade
at night. Something will occur sooner or
later and I shall say, “Hah, my diary, my
tablets, my ink fountain, that I may write
down something special and wonderful and
curious that has occurred to me this day.”</p>

<p>Some are so fortunate that their professional
and intellectual life blend—the writer, the
artist, the social worker, the barrister, sometimes
the lawyer, the politician, often the doctor.
Matters of deep interest professionally
have also a personal spiritual interest. But
whatever the profession or calling all interests
become one on an occasion of travel, on a
tramping expedition or visit to a strange
country. Then the daybook rests in the inner
pocket, the ready helpmeet of one’s thoughts.</p>

<p>In visiting foreign countries and studying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
other peoples, I always look out for what may
be called key phenomena. I like to be able to
record a fact which means so much more than
its bare utterance seems to imply. Such a fact,
bursting with brilliant significance is like a
luminary on the page. It may be light on
your way for the whole of the year. A nation
reveals its secret in a sentence. Or it may be,
an animal tells its nature by one trait observed.
There is a curious satisfaction of the soul in
knowing about the ways of men and of beasts.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not mean that there is any
particular satisfaction in recording trivialities
and prejudices. A man once wrote in his
diary, “The Frenchmen eat frogs: I do not
like them.” It was not worth his writing
down. But one day, tramping with a hungry
American, I was astonished to hear him exclaim,
“I wish I could see a frog; I would soon
have him in the pot.” That rid me of a prejudice,
and I sat down complacently afterwards
to a dish of frogs’ legs. It was worth a
line in the diary.</p>

<p>A pilgrim once said to me: “I do not know
you; to know a man one must eat forty pounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
of salt.” It was worth a line in my diary.
“<i>Nitchevo</i>,” said a Russian peasant servant to
Bismarck, when out hunting they were lost in
the snow in the forest. “<i>Nitchevo</i>,” and it
lasted Bismarck all his life. He never forgot
<i>Nitchevo</i> and was always fond of saying it.
“He is a gentleman; he keeps a gig,” Carlyle
overheard, and it became one of the brevities
of his spiritual life—“gigmanity.” “I am a
workingman; I have carried my dinner pail,”
some one else said, defining himself and a
workingman at the same time. Such definitions
and explanations, pointers, and street
lamps, are worth keeping.</p>

<p>The diary of this kind is sometimes called a
Commonplace book, which, however, seems to
me too modest a title, as one does not inscribe
in it one’s commonplaces. The Dean of St.
Paul’s published recently large extracts from
a wonderful series of “Commonplace books,”
which he had kept during most of his life, but
I would rather call them uncommonplace
books. Truly, in the Dean’s case these scrapbooks
garnered the fruits of reading rather
than of life, and my especial plea is not for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
fruits of reading as for the fruits of life. The
digest of books is the habit of the good student,
who sets down in brevity the content of whatever
he reads and so preserves knowledge
for future guidance. But the keeping of
the daybook represents a different habit of
mind.</p>

<p>With many it begins in happy school days
or school holidays when natural history diaries
were started. The enthusiastic collector of
birds’ eggs, butterflies, or beetles, makes constant
expeditions and delights in chronicling
the results. He may do it at length, or briefly;
may describe habits of species and adventures
in tracking them, or merely set down the
names of captures and of the localities. In
boyhood one records the marvelous doings of
the oak-egger female; later on one records
what man, the insect, is doing.</p>

<p>It is just as much worth while, though so
much more difficult, to describe what people
look like as to set down what they say. And
then most people and things are silent to our
ears; they speak more to our eyes. Certain
shapes, certain groups, speak at times enormously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
to our eyes. But how record them if
we do not describe?</p>

<p>It is in description that the keeper of a diary
becomes artist. All description is art, and in
describing an event, an action or a being, you
enter to some extent into the joy of art. You
are more than the mere secretary of life, patiently
taking down from dictation, more than
life’s mere scribe; you become its singer, the
expresser of the glory of it. With a verbal
description goes also sketching, the thumb-nail
sketch, the vague impression, the pictorial
pointer. There is no reason for being afraid
of bad drawing in one’s own personal travel
diary; the main thing is that it be ours and
have some relationship to our eyes and the
thing seen.</p>

<p>I have seldom gone on a tramp, or a long
vagabondage, without seeing things that made
the heart ache with their beauty or pathos, and
other things that set the mind a-tingle with intellectual
curiosity. I do not refer to great
episodes, glimpses of important shows and
functions, but to little things, unexpected
visions of life! Some were unforgettable in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
themselves and seemingly needed no tablets
other than those of memory, and yet it was a
great addition to inner content and happiness
to describe them as they occurred in my daybook
of travel.</p>

<p>It is good also, after describing something
that has specially affected one, to add one’s
observations, the one line perhaps that records
one’s mind at the time.</p>

<p>For these, and for other reasons, the artist’s
notebook, the diary, the common- and uncommonplace
book, the daybook of the soul are to
be placed as part of the equipment of life,
when faring forth, be it on pilgrimage, be it on
tramp, or be it merely on the common round
of daily life. Every entry is a shade of self-confession,

<p class="c sp lp">MAPS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>IVILIZATION is short of maps. It is
not familiar with its own ground plan.
This is due, no doubt, to the common handicap
of commercialism. Maps ought to be free for
all. When you ask a man the way, you do
not expect him to charge you for it—“the first
on the right and the second on the left; sixpence,
please.” Maps are almost as cheap to
print as wall paper, and could often be used
as such. We need to be familiarized with the
look of the chart of the world. It is of good
advantage, especially to children and to young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
men and women at the gateway of larger life,
to have maps of the world in front of them, in
front of them often.</p>

<p>You have inherited a pretty large estate by
being born. You might as well know something
of the plan of the grounds. Stay-at-home
natures are bred by absence of wall
maps. An interesting place, the old world,
with some curious corners—but the mapless
do not believe in it.</p>

<p>Geranium follows geranium on the bedroom
wall, and duck follows duck, and then in the
nursery innumerable Mother Hubbards look
in innumerable empty cupboards for innumerable
nonexisting bones, and then in the study
and workroom an endless series of pale violet
rails run back and forth or posies of spoiled
forget-me-nots bobble before the eyes. We
break the monotony with illuminated texts,
samplers, oleographs of the battle of Spion
Kop, portraits of aged relatives in company
with “The Laughing Cavalier.” We put
“God bless our Home” in large letters over
the hearth—and then forget about maps which
are full of blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>In Paris, even at the kiosks on the boulevards
you can buy maps of the world for a
few francs; large separate maps of Europe
and Asia and America, printed in color on
paper. You do not need them on canvas. It
is almost worth going to Paris to get supplies
of these. Thinking of getting married: go to
Paris and get plenty of maps for the new
home.</p>

<p>Atlases are not so good. You have to take
them down from a shelf and consult them.
Wall maps spare you the trouble; they consult
you. Atlases are to be consciously studied; wall
maps are busy studying you while you are
thinking of other things. You are reading
the <i>Arabian Nights</i> but Arabia is reading you.
You are turning over the pages of a picture
book with a child; Siam is looking over your
shoulder at the elephants. You are cooking
a curry; India has marked you. As you lie
in bed you see that Czechoslovakia is lying in
bed, too, with her toes in the Carpathians.</p>

<p>Atlases have a serious defect, in that they
split up the world as a butcher does a sheep,
and the joints are hanging in an absurd series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
on hooks. Separate maps of countries and
bits of countries, as for example, northwest
Germany, are not so instructive as large composite
maps. It is better to look at Europe
as a whole than at Europe in detail. Nevertheless,
a tiny book-page map of the world or
Europe or America or Asia, is of very little
value. There is no merit in the miniature
map. The bigger the map the better—up to
a point. It should not be so large that one
needs a ladder to examine Greenland. The
atlas and the pocket map and the revolving
sphere are the auxiliaries of the wall maps—very
useful in their place if the first has been
provided.</p>

<p>When the inspiration for wandering and
tramping has come we realize what a boon
maps are, we come to love them, as inseparable
companions. You put local maps of
countries and towns and countrysides in your
pockets, and large folded maps of the Continent
in your knapsacks. You unfold them in
the desert; you lie on them, you crawl about
with a magnifying glass examining their small
print and the lost names of villages in smudged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
mountain ranges. You learn by the scale
what the length of your thumb or little finger
means in kilometers and miles. You survey
with a curious joy the dotted line of your peregrinations
up to that point.</p>

<p>Have you seen enough of the world? Are
you sure you will rest content at Kensal Rise
or Père la Chaise when the time comes? Take
a map of the world and a blue pencil, go back
in memory over the whole of your life, start
the pencil at your birthplace, and begin to
draw the line of your goings to and fro upon
the world. How you will rejoice in yourself
if you can conduct that blue pencil chart across
a great ocean, across Atlantic or Pacific! The
longer and more bulging and loopy the line
the more you will feel you have lived. In the
later years of your life you will be able to say:
“I was born into the world and I have seen
something of it.”</p>

<p>Of course, maps have another function besides
that of firing your imagination, and it
would be neglectful to omit a further serious
consideration. They are for helping you to
find your way. How to read maps in detail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
is a matter of some study, as there is much
more information hidden in a good scientific
map of a country than at first meets the eye.
When tramping across forest and mountain
it is as well to carry with one sections of the
Government survey, by the aid of which one
can often locate oneself when otherwise hopelessly
lost. You know also where you must
make for for provisions, and whether you are
approaching a marshy region which cannot be
traversed on foot, where the fordings and ferries
and bridges of a river or stream are to be
found, where a forest ends, where open country
is resumed. One inevitably spends hours
of some days with one’s sectional map, trying
to make out what point has been reached, verifying
detail and verifying again.</p>

<p>This sort of map ought to be stoutly
mounted, as it comes in for much use and is
entirely in a different category from the large
composite maps suitable for home or for folding
within the large inner pocket of the knapsack.
You thumb them so much because almost
inevitably you come upon error, even in
the best survey. It is highly difficult to digest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
square miles and square inches. Every map
has an element of artistic impressionism, and
has to be studied somewhat intuitively. What
you would mark, it omits, because the map
maker was of a different temperament. For
that you have to allow, and not lose your patience
and tear up your guide.</p>

<p>At home it is well to have a map cupboard
and preserve and put in it every little map
which has ever served you on the road or in
foreign cities. You may help others with your
old maps upon occasion, and you may help
yourself when thinking of returning at some
time upon an old track.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>

<p class="c sp lp">TRESPASSERS’ WALK</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU are going to be very ill-mannered
and stray on to other people’s property.
Granted that fundamental impertinence you
must be as nice as possible about it; graciously
lift your hat to the proprietor when you see
him. You should be as careful to do as little
damage as possible; mend the hedge you have
broken, put back the hurdle, avert your face
if a lady is swimming in her private pool. In
doing the trespassers’ walk it is as well to
forego the happiness of a rigid rule. You take
your compass; you decide, let us say, to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
west southwest, and it will take you over commons,
over ploughed land, village greens,
graveyards, gardens, over loosely held but
large and idle estates, perhaps through thickly
propertied country. It is enough to do the
walk roughly. You cannot follow a ruled
straight line across sown fields and flower beds
and through the lord of the manor’s kitchen.
You must frame exceptions to the ruling of
the compass, and be guided by the dictates of
the heart and of good sense. The main idea is
to see just what the land of a given country
is like, and to enjoy it. You have the added
thrill of not knowing whom you will meet and
on what terms.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not guarantee that you may
not come to grief. You may get on to the
grounds of a very peppery squire who, resenting
greatly your trespass on his land, will
assail you in person, or set his keepers on you,
or even let loose a fierce dog, or telephone the
police. My experience is that you need not
fear these chances unless you behave badly.
Many landowners tacitly allow the neighboring
villagers to wander in their grounds if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
do not do damage. The parvenu comes and
tries to clear every one out, and keep his pleasaunce
entirely for himself, but even he, unless
he be a Seigneur of a Channel island will not
fire on a stranger at sight. The fact is, that in
England anyway, there is no absolute right to
keep strangers off private property. Formerly,
possessed land was much more free to
the use of the people in general than it is now.
The tradition remains. No farmer objects
to your walking alongside his cornfields or
across his pastures. It is the people who enclose
but do not farm who have most prejudice
against strangers.</p>

<p>No doubt bitternesses over rights of way
have hardened owners’ hearts; no doubt the
breakdown of feudal relationship between
squire and villager has helped to make the former
a recluse; no doubt the increasing vulgarity
and bad manners of people in general
have made them less welcome in the eyes and
on the estates of the refined and well-to-do.</p>

<p>But unless you do damage you are not committing
a serious offense by trespassing. And
the trespassers’ walk is so arduous that it can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
only be recommended to the few. It is worth
while, not merely as an adventure, but as a
means of getting a true notion of your native
land. You can get it hunting; but then, not
every one hunts.</p>

<p>One is inclined to think of England as a
network of motor roads interspersed with
public houses, placarded by petrol advertisements,
and broken by smoky industrial towns.
That England is a fair country few will deny,
because you see beautiful cross sections of her
from trains. But when you get out at a railway
station, the vision of the carriage window
is seldom realized. You are guided away from
Nature, by gulleys and deep-cut or hedged
roads. England becomes to you a dusty road,
a series of dusty roads.</p>

<p>There are glorious commons here and there,
and free woods, but you must travel to find
them. You get tired of thoroughly tamed
Sussex and Surrey and go to the Welsh hills
or the Cumberland lakes. But England is
more in Sussex and Surrey than it is in the
mountains. Only it is enclosed, shut away,
and marked “private.” Rain-washed notices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
put up ages ago tell you that <span class="smcap">Trespassers
Will Be Prosecuted</span>. And as we pray daily
in old-fashioned phrase to have our trespasses
forgiven we invest the idea of trespassing with
some awe. So we keep to the road, even if we
are out on a mere idle walk and not bent on
reaching any given house or place. Even if
you take a stile and leave road for footpath
your pleasure is enhanced, and if you leave
footpath for the “trackless” woods it is even
further enhanced.</p>

<p>For the trespassers’ walk you should be
lightly clad and shod, for you have to jump
often. You can start at any point you choose,
and take the guidance of the compass, or the
sun, or some dominant landmark in the view.
You then take a bee line and see where it leads
you. As you are neither a bee nor a bird you
cannot fly over hedges and walls, and you cannot
go so fast. Every field presents its problem,
but every field presents also its pleasure.</p>

<p>You will observe the different way the wild
flowers look on the other side of the hedge
that skirts the road; they are sheltered and
fresh and more numerous and altogether more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
happy. Even that first field is a more pleasant
place than the great highway.</p>

<p>The second hedge is likely to be lighter and
more easy to get through than the first. You
come into a broad meadow, and see beyond it
the darkness of a woodland you have never
entered. On the fringe of it the rabbits are
playing. In the bushes are more nests, more
fluttering of birds. You enter the wood. It
is still and dreaming, apparently utterly unpopulated.
It belongs to some quiet family
living in a big secluded country house a mile
away. There is room for a tribe where but
five people and their servants are living. Naturally
enough, you meet no one. You are in
woodland which is after all but little visited
though in the midst of crowded England. The
berries on the blackberry bushes rot unpicked.
No one comes seeking the many mushrooms.
Even the rabbits are only shot at once a year—to
keep their numbers down. You are treading
on last year’s leaves, or the leaves of the
year before last, on the leaf mold of ages past.
England is carpeted under your feet. You
delight in your steps, in the rise and fall of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
land, in the sunny clearing and the vetch-covered
bank where you sit watching little
blue and brown butterflies fluttering about
you.</p>

<p>No one comes to chase you off. At least
you are not a trespasser until some one has
seen you. You hear no one moving anywhere.
You do not even hear the motor cars on the
road you left. You have disenchanted the
England of those roads. This is the real England,
the England into which you ought to
have been born, rather than that of curbed
ways and tarred roads.</p>

<p>From the woods you emerge on to a fair
pleasaunce, an upward-reaching greensward,
flanked afar by a white house—the owner’s
probably. Your eyes turn wistfully towards
the house and its windows, but there seems to
be no one there, it might be empty. There is
not even a smoke from a chimney. You climb
the green slope to another wood, and passing
through it, come unexpectedly to a gap, no, a
ditch, no, a country road, a lane, leading from
you do not know where to you do not know
what.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>You go down into it; you climb up on the
other side. You have entered a different type
of property. You are in a turnip field, which
you skirt. In your next field you see a fearsome
animal all by himself, grazing at leisure,
and it depends on your courage whether you
will face the bull or make an exception to your
rule of the game of the walk.</p>

<p>It is well to have a notebook and record the
rules, by-laws, and exceptions of your walk as
you frame them. In this notebook also you
keep a personal record of the England you
found the other side of the hedge.</p>

<p>Upon seeing a bull you decide to pass him
in the spirit of an escaping <i>torero</i>, or you
make a rule to meet the danger. You take a
bearing by your pocket compass, and ascertain
what tree or landmark you are naturally
making for on the other side of the bull’s field.
And having assured yourself of that, you reach
it by making a detour.</p>

<p>Then, proceeding with your tramp, you go
right through a farmhouse yard. If the compass
directs that you should go right through
the farmhouse you may go in and get some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
refreshment. You do not avoid the farmer
and his spouse, or farm hands. They are part
of your novel adventure, and are nearly always
quite pleased to see you, even if a bit puzzled
at your line of route.</p>

<p>It is just as well not to explain what you
are up to. They will not take to it. They do
not mind your walking across the farm with
a given object, but will fail to understand your
notion of following the compass. Assuredly
they will think you rogue or mad. It is best
to talk politics to them, talk of that terrible
fellow Ramsay MacDonald and the dreadful
doings of Labor; they love that. Your interest
in the stock will not come amiss. You may
ask also of land for sale, of estates falling
vacant, and changes of ownership. They will
tell you much about the owners of the land
you travel over. The difficulty is in getting
away from a farm and making the crazy exit
that your compass dictates. There again a
rule may be framed. You may select a point
in view ahead and get to it conventionally, resuming
your bee line across country there.</p>

<p>You are in for a delightful day or for delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
days of tramping. If you have a
cottage in the country, as I had when doing
this, you can do a few hours of this and then
return by road or rail home, resuming, another
day, at the point where you left off. On the
other hand, if the weather is fine, there is no
reason why you should not sleep out and
tramp all the way to the sea. Only it will take
longer than could be expected, as getting over
hedges and walls and ditches and streams
takes time. And it is more tiring than an
ordinary walk on a moor or a common.</p>

<p>On a long tour of the kind you learn something
about English life which is not easily
obtained in a conventional way, and the experience
should be filled out by learning the
names and histories of estates and owners. If
you have friends on the way you can have delightful
accidental meetings and enriching
conversations. If you are seriously studying
English life there is no reason why you should
not frankly call at the houses you see on the
way and get what information you can. Some
people may meet you coldly, a few boorishly,
but most will be polite and friendly enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Occasionally you will meet people who will be
extremely kind and helpful. It is neither so
wicked nor so dangerous to be a trespasser as
might at first appear.</p>

<p class="c sp lp less">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>

<p class="c sp lp">A ZIGZAG WALK</p>


<p><span class="dropcap1">I</span> HAVE mentioned the “zigzag” walk.
Did you ever make one? Probably not,
for it is my secret. I invented it. A frequent
wish of the traveler and wanderer is to obtain
genuinely chance impressions of cities and
countries. He would trust neither his own
choice of road, nor the guide’s choice, nor the
map. But if he goes forth aimlessly he inevitably
finds himself either making for the gayer
and better-lighted places, or returning to his
own door. The problem is to let chance and
the town take charge of you, for the world we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
travel in is more wonderful than human plan
or idle hearts desire.</p>

<p>One day in New York, wishing to explore
that great city in a truly haphazard way I hit
on the following device—a zigzag walk. The
first turning to the left is the way of the heart.
Take it at random and you are sure to find
something pleasant and diverting. Take the
left again and the piquancy may be repeated.
But reason must come to the rescue, and you
must turn to the right in order to save yourself
from a mere uninteresting circle. To
make a zigzag walk you take the first turning
to the left, the first to the right, then the first
to the left again, and so on.</p>

<p>I had a wonderful night’s walking thus in
New York, taking cross sections of that marvelous
cosmopolitan city. And many were
the surprises and delights and curiosities that
the city unfolded to me in its purlieus and
alleys and highways and quays. That was several
years ago. After New York I saw Paris
for the first time, and wandered that way
there. Curiously enough, I started from the
conventional and tourist-stricken Avenue de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
l’Opéra, and the zigzag plan led me across the
Seine to the Quartier Latin and Bohemian
Montparnasse. I saw more of Paris in a night
than many may do in a month. After Paris
I tried the experiment in Cologne. That was
after I had marched in with my regiment from
the wilds of the Ardennes and southern Germany.
I explored the city in that way. How
unusual and real and satisfactory were the
impressions obtained by going—not the
crowd’s way, but the way of the zigzag, the
diagonal between heart and reason.</p>

<p>However, the most charming and delightful
associations of my zigzag walk are not those
of the great foreign cities which I have known,
but of our mysterious and crooked-streeted
capital, London herself.</p>

<p>It was Christmas time and I said to my
wife: “Let us do our shopping on the zigzag
way.” We had not gone forth on such an
adventure before, and were full of excitement,
wondering where we should be led. What
exactly we bought on the way I do not wholly
remember, but London was generous to us in
its cross section of houses and shops. On this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
occasion we started on the road of reason, since
we had a definite purpose in view, and we took
the first on the right, and the first on the left,
instead of the first on the left, and the first on
the right. It may be thought that made no
difference. Believe me, all the difference in
the world!</p>

<p>The first street we knew quite well, the second
was an asphalt alley, where scores of children
were playing hop-o’-my-thumb on the
white-scrawled flagstones. The third street
was one of the great film streets of London,
with cinema stores from end to end and shop
windows lurid with horror posters. The fourth
turning brought us to the famous market of
Pulteney, where all the surplus fruit and job
lots of vegetables from Covent Garden are
exhibited on donkey barrows, and cried by
vociferous hawkers. Here we could buy
two grapefruit on occasion for a penny,
and the “rare and refreshing fruit” which
the wizard from Wales once offered to the
poor as a result of legislation could here be
obtained by chance and in abundance. From
the market we went by a crooked road from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Rupert Street to Callard’s cake shop in
Regent Street.</p>

<p>Happy forethought of London! We had
coffee and mustard-and-cress sandwiches in
this jolly shop, and bought a cake. Then we
crossed Regent Street, bought two chickens
at Louis Gautier’s in Swallow Street, and
plunged for Piccadilly. We came out at St.
James’ Church, and fortune was kind enough
to make it possible to visit Hatchards. We
went in and “browsed around” for a while and
ordered a copy of <i>The Sweet-scented Name</i>.
Our way was then by Duke Street, Jermyn
Street and some others to St. James’ Street
with its clubs, and we turned up St. James’
Place. As we passed Number Five, rat-a-tat-tat,
from a little window; rattling and jumping
like the sound of an old-fashioned motor,
went the typing machine of the secretary of
the world’s greatest newspaper chief. We
thought we had arrived at a cul-de-sac and
that we should have to retrace our footsteps—one
of the natural rules of the walk—but we
found an eye of a needle through which the
rich men have to pass to get to the Paradise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
of the Green Park. It is always explained to
the rich that the eye of the needle in the Gospel
is only a figure of speech, and that there was
a needle gate through which a camel, without
too great a hump, could pass, and the alley
from St. James’ Place will just admit the
not too stout.</p>

<p>When we got to the fields beyond, the great
city played with us and led us a comic dance
along the paths of the Green Park. Westminster
Cathedral was in view. There was a
large balloon overhead in the murk of the London
sky, and many people were looking up at
it. Our steps took us along various grand
crescents of pathway, and the intention of the
city with regard to our ultimate destination
began to seem very obscure. There were several
knotty points as to which was a turning
and which was not, and when I made an artful
decision the companion of my way said to me,
“You want to shape things to your own ends.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I. “I want to be faithful and
just.”</p>

<p>A stiff discussion set in and we could not get
the matter straight. However, we eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
found ourselves in St. James’ Park, and there
was an issue for us into Birdcage Walk where,
in the barracks beyond, we saw the soldiers
at drill, though little did I think at the time
that I was destined to drill there, and be on
sentry there myself in time to come.</p>

<p>So the walk went on, and we passed the
London Soldiers’ Home near Buckingham
Gate, made our last purchase at a little shop
in Wilfred Street, passed Westminster City
School, and entered Victoria Street by Palace
Street and took an omnibus home.</p>

<p>Thus ended the first lap of our zigzag walk
through London, and we promised ourselves
to return to the point where we had left off
and continue this way of chance as soon as a
convenient moment came.</p>

<p>Therefore, one Sunday afternoon, and not
long after, we took the omnibus back to the
corner of Palace Street and resumed. Fate
allowed us to miss Victoria Station, and its
many lines of rail, and we entered Flatdom
and Belgravia, not the best part of Belgravia,
but the sadder and more faded streets, the
streets where the lamps of joy had died down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
and guttered out. Then we passed by Moreton
Terrace to Lupus Street (“What a name
for a London street!” says G. A. B. Dewar,
in his sad tale of <i>Letty</i>—“Is not all London
wolfish street for our Lettys?”), Colchester
Street, Chichester Street, Claverton Street,
streets of faded grandeur, the Embankment.
Then over the river we go by Chelsea Bridge
and find ourselves in a district hitherto unvisited
by us.</p>

<p>We entered Battersea Park and had such
a time in its mazes of paths that we were
obliged to make a second rule for our walks,
and that was that henceforward we should
enter no parks. A friend to whom we had
communicated the secret of our street adventure
had warned us that if in the near future
we should disappear from London life he
would come in search of us to the Maze at
Hampton Court, from which, he was afraid,
once entered, we should never extricate ourselves.
So we made a rule: No parks, no
mazes. Incidentally, however, we spent a remarkable
and amusing hour in that artificial
wilderness of Battersea. If zigzagging should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
ever become fashionable I am afraid that most
people will consider it <i>de rigueur</i> to follow out
the mazes and labyrinths to the last intricacy
and the correct issue, and that they will not
have the courage to cut the Gordian knot as we
did. And starting pedantically they will finish
pedantically—in the literal sense, for is not
<i>pes</i>, <i>pedis</i>, a foot. There were many Gordian
knots which our footsteps made in the ins and
outs of London.</p>

<p>Having given Battersea Park the go-by, we
threaded many typically poor streets, not
slum, just better than that. How deplorable
a sight! Very poor and dirty houses which
you feel moving to be worse, with broken windows
here and there, and derelict barrows in
the roadway. We passed under gloomy railway
arches, so gloomy, as if crimes had been
committed there, arches where at night spooning
couples lurk or solitary bodies furtively
eat fish and chips. So we came to a little
house which, in the course of time, we ought
to have visited, but probably would not, and
there we called in our unexpected way—a call
not without its sequence in our after-life. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
was all in the realm of Lavender Walk and
Battersea Rise. In one of the streets we came
on two demure villas called Alpha and Omega,
and very fitly passed from Battersea to
Wandsworth.</p>

<p>Another day, in full fresh air, we walked
along Bolingbroke Grove and the fringe of
the Common and Nightingale Lane, through
very respectable Suburbia, where the houses
are just so, and there are plaster angels in the
cemeteries. That day we went home from
Earlsfield Station. Next time we passed St.
Barnabas’ Church with the niches left in the
bricks for saints. We made our exit from real
London, watching from a railway arch the
mad red caterpillars of tube trains going to
and fro. The houses grew higher and the roads
more spacious, and great elm trees were in
the front gardens. With wild wind and rolling
sky, ’twixt Putney Heath and the golf
links of Wimbledon, we finished up one jolly
afternoon by coming unexpectedly to tea at
the house of another friend to which without
jiggery-pokery the zigzag way had led us.</p>

<p>The next afternoon on which we ventured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
forth we wandered to sad Merton and the
fringe of outer Suburbia. There were fields,
but they had Destiny’s mark upon them; they
were doomed to be imprisoned with brick by
the London which was encroaching, encroaching.</p>

<p>Coming to this pseudo-country we made another
rule. When footpaths occur we have
the option whether to take them or no. (In
future, as I have observed, all footpaths will
no doubt be <i>de rigueur</i>.) A footpath took us
to Lower Morden and another footpath took
us through much mud, to farms, to old houses
with meadows in front of them, and fine trees
with many angles. The path degenerated from
a rolling series of cart ruts to a faint track
along the margin of a field, and faded away
at last into wormrun grass. A dreadful moment.
Presently, spying round, we saw a
faded notice on a board—<span class="smcap">No Footpath</span>—but,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0"><i>Man is man, and master of his fate,</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and we made another rule.</p>

<p>In short we cut across the fields to a row<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
of houses protected by fierce-looking barbed-wire
entanglements. We got on to another
footpath and the footpath became a road and
the road became a grand drive. I think we
got to Blenheim Road, and that this degenerated
to a cart track, and we were led over fields
to the West Barnes Road, where trams and
busses were running and we saw scrawled in
front of us in big white letters—“<span class="smcap">Eternity—In
Heaven or Hell.</span> Vote Now.” We voted.
Somehow we got to Raynes Park, and were
much pleased with the front garden of Carter’s
Seed Establishment and the many flowerpots
and the ice plants.</p>

<p>Next day we reflected that we had become
enmeshed in a net of our own contrivance.
Our little plan didn’t at all fit in with the
arrangement of the district. Suburbia, with
crocuses in bloom, got rather on our nerves.
By many circumlocutions we returned to
Wimbledon. We did not know the name of
the place was Wimbledon, but when we discovered
this melancholy fact we realized that
we had blisters on our feet.</p>

<p>Another day we walked to Malden, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
we bought an excellent chicken which we took
home in time for supper. Then by Sycamore
Grove we walked to Poplar Grove, and by
Poplar Grove we walked to Lime Grove, and
by Lime Grove to Elm Road, by Elm Road
to Beech Grove. We took the option of a
footpath and skidded from this region of trees
to the main highway, where the fine Hampton
Court electric cars speed their handsome way.
We went straight into Kingston without any
more beating about the bush. We should ordinarily
have gone in by the open highroad,
but an alley forestalled that conventionality,
and we entered by a wee way which took us
inside the house of the parish, and we saw all
the children playing everywhere upon the floor.
Rather slummy. We passed Milner Villas
(built 1902), we passed The Victoria, The
Six Bells, and The Three Tuns, passed the
Kingston Grammar School, where the boys
have scarlet caps, and the Bunyan Baptist
Tabernacle where the pastor had the kenspeckle
name of Isaac Stalberg. There was a
strong smell of marmalade from St. James’
Works, and Kingston Station was puffing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
with locomotive steam. Night had spread its
glamour over everything, and we walked by
several slums down to The Jolly Brewers,
along paved passages and in the purlieus of
the gas works, by further passages where were
no houses, to the sight of the greenish mud-colored
river and the rusty coppery railway
bridge. The old stone bridge of Kingston
also stood beautifully in our view.</p>

<p>When we returned to Kingston there was a
lonely but lovely walk along Thames side,
seeking a bridge to give us a turning on the
left, with sun and wind and rain, and ducks
falling through the air with a <i>ssh</i>, and cunning
swans sailing forward expecting food, and
crying gulls. It was the towing path toward
Teddington Lock. The riverside houses came
down to the water with lawns and landing
stages, terraces, gardens, formal beauties. The
Thames is a fair stream; we have made it fair.
Once it was otherwise, and England also—unnamed,
unloved, wild, woody, marshy.
Man has made it dear unto himself. In the
ever freshening morning we stood on the
bridge at Teddington and looked at the waters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
rolling over the dam, and the green park land
and the gardens beyond.</p>

<p>We wondered very much how we should
depart from the other bank of the river, what
direction Fate would have us take. But we
never could guess in advance. Generally we
would say: “I believe to-day we shall land
up somewhere in the neighborhood of this
place or that,” but our prognostications were
never justified. Thus, who would have expected
that having passed through Teddington
we should arrive at the other side of Kingston
stone bridge and be called upon to return
to our starting point!</p>

<p>We wandered through an area of large
houses possessing a certain sort of pomp and
gloom, happy in the summer, not so happy in
the winter. And then an area of little Hope
Cottages and May Villas. Somewhere in the
neighborhood of Seymour Road and Lower
Teddington Road we came to a highly disputable
loop of roadway which betrayed us to
the return over Kingston Bridge.</p>

<p>We felt highly annoyed when we saw this
main plank which we were about to be forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
to walk. I, with Machiavellian cunning, proposed
to return to that fatal loop of roadway
and reinterpret its bearing, and we stood on
the triangular refuge in the middle of the
roadway, and discussed the point hotly. This
is distinctly not a walk on which to embark
with one’s wife. It reveals points of difference.
It brings out the hidden crookedness of
character, confirms all obstinacies and predeterminations.
It is possible to get more excited
over a trivial turning (mark you, trivial,
a place where three ways meet) than over the
most portentous decision in real life. I imagine
it is always so. In any case, we stood on
the triangle at Kingston and argued the point.
Two stout policemen of the cinema picture
type stood over on the pavement, regarding us
and nodding their heads together. “What do
you think is their little game?” one was possibly
saying to the other, and they must have
viewed me with a considerable amount of suspicion
when I returned to that loop and obtained
a heretical reading of the truth to suit
my purpose.</p>

<p>“My dear Watson,” I hear the arch-detective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
saying, “the simplest of crimes are always
the most difficult to fathom.” I think it would
have puzzled the smartest of plain-clothes men
had he followed us on our marvelous way from
Kingston back to Kingston, or from Kingston
the second time to Hampton Court.</p>

<p>“Onward to Hampton,” said I. “We cannot
tell what joys await us there.” We went
into Bushey Park, thus infringing one of our
own rules, but there was an excellent road
going through, and we liked to see the deer
grazing near us, like cows. Fortune led us
into Hampton, that gay and lively river town,
and from Hampton we wandered among gray
reservoirs and green embankments to Sunbury.
Possibly Fate intervened to punish us
for our refusal to pass over Kingston Bridge,
for soon we found ourselves clinging to the
Thames. It was March by now. The blackthorn
was in bloom, the japonica and the
almond were in blossom, the celandine was in
bud, and birds were singing everywhere. At
Ashford there were lots of daffodils, and I
remember we passed the girls of the High
School all walking in crocodile and looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
very frisky and fresh, despite the primness of
the teacher.</p>

<p>We came to the pretty and rural village of
Laleham, Arnold’s village, with its old church
with thickly ivied tower, ancient yew trees, and
graves of the Arnolds and of the village.
There were two goodly inns, the Turk’s
Head, the Three Horseshoes. At the latter
we had tea, and we learned that Arnold’s
house had been pulled down and the present
National School had been made with the
bricks.</p>

<p>We walked along the towing path once
more, but it was now a full, rushing river and
was often in flood, well over the bank. The
Thames had a wild aspect, reflecting livid
clouds. An icy gale whipped the stream.
There was a rush of snow, and the storm raged
across the whiteness of the horizon like smoke.
We sheltered in the coping of deserted river
houses, and in order to make progress when
the storm abated were obliged to walk on the
iron rungs of railings. Even so, we did not
escape many a bootful. In this way we passed
Penton Hook, and reached, fairly and truly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
Staines, one of the bright capitals of Father
Thames’ kingdom.</p>

<p>At Staines we took the bridge, or rather the
bridge took us over to the other side of the
river where we waded all the way to Runnymede
and Magna Carta Island—the way all
Kings evidently have to go. But we signed
no charter of rights. Had we worn crowns
we stood in more likelihood of imitating that
other remarkable feat of King John, by losing
our symbols of royalty in the flood. We were
slaves of the road, and the road led us into the
water. I think we should have got to Windsor
Castle and might conceivably have called
on the King himself, the latest after King
John, but the water gods intervened, or Pan
had other things in view. For I was warped,
we were warped away to Egham and Virginia
Water. I was able to call on my artist friend,
Helen Cross, who at that time lived at Egham
and was doing the emblems for my idealistic
first novel <i>Priest of the Ideal</i>; a joyous surprise
visit, for I could not tell her in advance
that I was coming. I did not know whether
the zigzag way led to her gate. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
many nice people and some others are on the
zigzag path in the jig-saw puzzle of life.</p>

<p>We went from Egham to Thorpe Green
and Englefield Green. We went down Prune
Hill and to Whitehall Farm and the length
of many a longish country road. It’s a long
lane that has no turning; in fact we were often
comforted by that proverb and never found
it disproved. All roads in England, except
the horrible cul-de-sacs (which, pray you,
avoid) have turnings to the left or to the right,
according to the heart or consonant to the
reason. The crookedest has some reason in
it, and even the worst, though it has a way in,
has also a way out.</p>

<p>From Virginia Water the zigzag way leads
on to Kennaquhair, and further to a place
which I have sometimes heard called the “back
of beyond.” At the same time, it may be said
that you will not know the name of the place
until you get there. You can put no destination
label on your rucksack, and if any one
asks where you are going, you may tell him
in confidence, whisper the dreadful fact in his
ear—“honestly, you do not know.” The adventure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
is not getting there, it’s the on-the-way.
It is not the expected; it is the surprise;
not the fulfillment of prophecy, but the providence
of something better than that prophesied.
You are not choosing what you shall
see in the world, but are giving the world an
even chance to see you.</p>

<p>I am still on that zigzag way, pursuing the
diagonal between the reason and the heart; the
chart could be made by drawing lines from
star to star in the night sky, not forgetting
many dim, shy, fitfully glimmering out-of-the-way
stars, which one would not purpose visiting.
I said we would not enter a maze, but
we have made one and are in one, a maze of
Andalusia and Dalmatia, of Anahuac and
Anatolia, of Seven Rivers Land and Seven
Kings. The first to the left, the next to the
right! No blind alleys. A long way. <i>Beaucoup
zigzag, eh!</i></p>
